The acting from Moore is superb, what a perfect cast for the role both as an actress and as a real life parody. She nailed it! I truly hope she wins some awards for this.

Qualley was fantastic too! And my goodness what a smoke show. Totally fit the 'perfect' other self. Guess I have a new crush! 

Genuine moments of sadness and empathy for Moore's character, wonderful storytelling. Was cracking up when she turned into the 'witch'.

Amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects! As plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie! Shout-out to Quaid as well!

Ending scene was nuts! Reminded me a little of the shock at the end of 'Ready or Not' (another fav of mine), which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of Kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding.

One of the best films of the year!",55,2024-09-20 02:06:52,"loved it not normally a big body horror fan but man this was so good

the acting from moore is superb, what a perfect cast for the role both as an actress and as a real life parody she nailed it i truly hope she wins some awards for this

qualley was fantastic too and my goodness what a smoke show totally fit the perfect other self guess i have a new crush 

genuine moments of sadness and empathy for moores character, wonderful storytelling was cracking up when she turned into the witch

amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects as plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie shoutout to quaid as well

ending scene was nuts reminded me a little of the shock at the end of ready or not another fav of mine, which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding her dying on her star was just a fantastic callback to the beginning of the film

one of the best films of the year"

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,2024-09-20 02:23:35,"Absolutely loved the film. It felt like a mix of Requiem for a Dream and Possessor. While giving viewers more then enough shocking gore and vile imagery, it also does an amazing job satirizing the entertainment industry and beauty standards. The scene where Demi Moore can’t go out on her date with Fred because of her constant obsession over her appearance was very sad. 

The technical elements are great too. They are pretty similar to Fargeat’s first film Revenge (2017), in terms of the way it is shot, edited, and scored. So if you enjoyed the vibe of that film, you will love this one. I believe The Substance is an improvement in every way over that film. Excited to see what she does next. Her and Brandon Cronenberg and going to be the faces of body-horror for years to come.",138,2024-09-20 02:06:52,"absolutely loved the film it felt like a mix of requiem for a dream and possessor while giving viewers more then enough shocking gore and vile imagery, it also does an amazing job satirizing the entertainment industry and beauty standards the scene where demi moore cant go out on her date with fred because of her constant obsession over her appearance was very sad

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,2024-09-22 21:06:55,"On one hand I couldn't help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death. Desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things don't go as planned etc etc. I remember the Facelift episode of American Horror Story and one of the episodes of Guillermo Del Toro's horror anthology having a similar bit.

But I think The Substance really killed it and made something that still felt totally unique.

The body horror was relentless and I love how they tease the feeling of dread and disgust with the constant closeups. For me one of the grossest parts was Sue getting greedy and draining Elizabeth for more and more fluid as the site got more and more infected. Then finally all that comes out is some bloody pus. I felt like I spent the entire second half of the movie with my hand over my face cringing.

It was great portraying self-hatred through literally two different versions of yourself in conflict and the inevitable climax of trying to destroy yourself. One thing I didn't like about that final fight scene was how absolutely fragile Elizabeth had become in an earlier scene, struggling to stand without breaking her knee. Now she's 100 times more decrepit and taking hits like a boxer and still standing up. I think she should have died a lot earlier to keep things from getting comical but then the vicious beating could have ensued long after to really drive home the point of psychotic self-hatred.

Seeing her reflection in the doorknob was a fantastic and sad moment. Bringing everything back to the beaten up hollywood star was a cool touch.

When the final monstro form crumbled to pieces and all that was left was her face poking out I ALMOST thought her whole normal body was going to emerge unscathed and then she'd get a banal call from the company saying the experience was complete. ""Thanks for choosing us!"" But I guess that would have been a bit too goofy for no reason.",41,2024-09-20 02:06:52,"on one hand i couldnt help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things dont go as planned etc etc i remember the facelift episode of american horror story and one of the episodes of guillermo del toros horror anthology having a similar bit

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,2024-09-20 04:24:32,"This might be ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THIS YEAR. Holy shit, Quaid (lol ""Harvey"" I seen what you did there) stole the scene every time he was on camera, Qualley really was out to be *that* alpha bitch, Moore's self loathing doubt and her losing it after the first half of the film made me laugh ruefully for her.

The plot is makes it clear that Sue was going to sabotage Elizabeth (I thought Elisabeth was gonna get revenge given the chicken in the navel bit by way of overeating then causing her to sprout food from herself...?) but I loved it's unpredictability and descent into utter chaos at the end. The ostensible cliche phrase ""take care of yourself"" had so much weight to it, plus I love the commentary on how showbiz will chew one up and spit you out especially if you're eye candy (dear lord so many butt shots, I'm assuming commentary on the male gaze?), and also body dysmorphia and the lengths one would go for self preservation. Speaking of eye candy the chaotic cinematography is chef's kiss, I loved also when Harvey was around he would speak to the camera whether it be Sue or Elisabeth.

The end of the film with Monstro Elisasue gave me so many mixed feelings of dark humor laughter at how unhinged it was, sadness out of a fading star, and shock at the horrifying amalgamation of body parts. You couldn't help feel sorry for the Elisabeth slime's last chance at happiness as she slowly fades at her Hall of Fame star (that foreshadowing at the beginning with the burger)

The only negatives I have are nitpicks: One the slow pacing until the middle of the film, two (suspension of disbelief be damned) how in gods name did Sue become an interior designer overnight?

TL;DR The social commentary, the chaos and unpredictability, great acting, and utterly over the top presentation for the film, make it one of my favorite films of the year so far!

9/10, don't pull chicken from your navel and while I think there was social commentary to be said, Qualley's got a nice ass

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,2024-09-21 11:12:48,"The movie was totally a modern fairy tale. People calling it a satire, but it has little to offer on that front. When taken as a fantastical tale on how one's vanity and self-absorption (note the recurring image of the giant photo of herself Elizabeth had put on her apartment's wall) can lead to one's doom, it works much better. 

If the movie was meant to be this scathing satire of the industry, then why show the protagonist flouting the instructions due to her own whims rather than industry's pressure? Like the first time she goes over the limit is so that she can fuck a random douchebag she's brought home, lol.

This is how I can tell that the symbols are functioning as such. I suppose that’s my most basic test for whether a movie is any good.

This is why I watch horror movies. It seems the usual method of making video entertainment is to throw in some symbols, hope something sticks… And it seems that horror alone follows symbols to see where they lead, and then the filmmaker reports their discoveries honestly.

Just a few examples from the movie: the glass box in which Elizabeth lives overlooking the city, the entire bathroom lol, the hallway to the bathroom, which is inexplicably spiral inside the other otherwise cubic apartment, the hallway at the TV studio, the camera lens, the colors… god that pink is oppressive!

I was so suspicious that the movie came from an intellectual/social commentary perspective. The kind of movie that would have been better as an essay. But no, this is the real deal. A dream that shakes you and stays with you.

It’s a real exercise in empathy to watch this as a man. I feel like I learned something about my species in my time and place.

Anyway, it’s a very good movie. I feel the same drive to watch it again, unpack it, look under the hood to see how it works… The same way I used to with the Coen Brothers in their heyday (Barton Fink through Inside Llewyn Davis)

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,2024-10-03 08:15:08,"Just saw it tonight and can’t stop thinking about it either. I avoid body gore at all costs so I put this one off and went in hesitantly, my hand halfway over my eyes. But by the first body gore scene I was entranced and couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. But the message, symbolism and overarching theme of this movie had me so hooked that I wasn’t bothered by the body gore. I felt empathy for her character as she sunk further into chasing her younger self + perfect face & body. She kept going, knowing there would be consequences, but she didn’t want to give it up. Body/beauty perfection can be addictive and often we don’t see the damage we do to ourselves until after it’s done. Extreme dieting, ED, cosmetic surgery, procedures, etc. taken to extreme lengths to achieve perfection, body dysmorphia, we end up hurting ourselves in the long run.) 
*recovering from an ED so a lot of this movie resonated with me*
Being accepting and happy with how we look as we age can be difficult, especially in a world of such demanding perfection for women to remain youthful and perky, while men age, look older, without being criticized or objectified. 
It’s polarizing and this movie did an amazing job at showing what a nightmare being objectified and chasing perfection can feel like. “Pretty girls should always smile.” Raise your hand if you cringe when men say that, and how young were you when a man first said it to you. I can’t wait to watch it again. Excellent movie; the best I’ve seen in a long time.",14,2024-09-12 12:51:35,"just saw it tonight and cant stop thinking about it either i avoid body gore at all costs so i put this one off and went in hesitantly, my hand halfway over my eyes but by the first body gore scene i was entranced and couldnt take my eyes off the screen but the message, symbolism and overarching theme of this movie had me so hooked that i wasnt bothered by the body gore i felt empathy for her character as she sunk further into chasing her younger self  perfect face  body she kept going, knowing there would be consequences, but she didnt want to give it up bodybeauty perfection can be addictive and often we dont see the damage we do to ourselves until after its done extreme dieting, ed, cosmetic surgery, procedures, etc taken to extreme lengths to achieve perfection, body dysmorphia, we end up hurting ourselves in the long run

The worst part is that there are many very good reviews for this movie, which just goes to show, you can’t trust everything you read online. This is the only reason we gave it a watch.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-09-23 16:31:41,"Had some time to digest this (and get to a computer rather than my phone).

I really appreciated this film for so many things (acting, practical effects, editing, score, etc.) but I really think there’s something special about the screenplay and that it really reflects a female POV that is missing from a lot of horror.

First, the real horror is so very internal. Elizabeth’s problem is not so much Hollywood or the way older women are tossed aside, though that’s certainly there, her real problem is the way she views and values herself. She is self destructive because the real problem is internal, it’s the way she views herself. She cannot see what we as viewers can see (and casting Demi Moore here was a stroke of genius) at any age, she is stunning by any societal standard—but that’s not how she sees herself. She sees herself as haggard and a monster, and when the “misuse of the substance” takes a toll on her, that’s the toll it takes. It makes her appear on the outside the way she feels and views herself on the inside. That scene before the date is heartbreaking if you’re a woman because we have all experienced that dysmorphia to some extent—that experience of being unable to really see yourself because of feelings of inadequacy. This really makes this film so different than most others—it’s not about being turning into a monster, it’s about seeing yourself as a monster.

The heartbreaking thing about Sue is that she's not a younger Elizabeth. She's someone else entirely. The best version of you (as a woman) isn't even YOU. It's someone else entirely. You were never good enough. And even the best version of you has insecurities because she's not good enough either.

Second, the narrative structure really emphasizes this. In a lot of screenplays, once Elizabeth unlocked Sue, Sue would have gone on to take down the man--- to get revenge on everyone in Hollywood who mistreated Elizabeth. But that’s not at all where the narrative goes. Because although there are many terrible characters, they really aren’t the antagonist. Elizabeth is both protagonist and antagonist. She is truly her own worst enemy, both in her Sue form but also in her Elizabeth form as she punishes herself by binging and trashing her apartment and destroying everything around herself. This could have very easily strayed into a revenge tale, and I think it’s partially the female POV that sidesteps that narrative to take the story in a different direction. 

Third, I love how the male gaze is used in this film. I think it’s very brave and effective. It’s not shown to be bad. It’s just cranked up to 11, and then 15, and then 200 until you are disgusted by it without being told to feel that way. All the huge close ups of bodies and body parts. Especially at the end, where Monstro Elisasue is just an amalgamation of body parts. It’s so in your face and unabashed. The end is seriously like “You like tits? You want tits? Here’s another one for ya!” It makes things so sexual that they become completely UN sexual. And all the nudity is presented in the most clinical of settings—against a white tiled bathroom. I’ve seen people say that they feel like the film falls into presenting the male gaze and I think that’s missing the point—it’s about letting the audience reject the male gaze in a way Elizabeth never really is able to. It’s wildly effective.

I see why this won a screenplay award at Cannes. It’s not only audacious and original but it has a POV that is largely absent from the genre and really deserves to be represented.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-09-19 16:33:33,"I don't know how to talk about this movie without it sounding hyperbole. I've never had a movie make me physically react the way this did. From the moment she got The Substance, I found myself with my hand over my mouth. I could see both people on the sides of me out of the corner of my eye were reacting the same way throughout the whole movie, and I'm sure if I could see the 4 rows behind me, they were too. I've watched all the main body horror movies people talk about, and none of them got me like this.



That last 30-45 minutes is just straight up insanity. When the movie ended, I just sat there for a minute, and then I went to the lobby and sat on the bench in complete disbelief, speechless. I loved everything about it. When I saw Margaret Qualley was staring in this, I knew it was gonna be something special. She was sensational, and so was Demi Moore. I don't really know how you top a movie like this. I really believe on all levels it was damn near perfection. Maybe it could've got trimmed down just a little bit but even for a movie that was over 2 hours long, you're so engrossed in everything that's happening on screen that it doesn't even feel like it has been that long.



This might be one of my favorite movies I have ever watched, definitely one of the best horrors and by far the best theater experience. I'll be waiting for another movie to top this theater experience. Hearing the whole crowd groan and make noises and physically react was awesome. I'm glad for once a movie not only lived up to the hype, but IMO exceeded it as well.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-09-21 03:15:19,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. I went in completely blind (well ok I read about one sentence that said Demi Moore is in it and she takes some drug to be younger and I knew it was a horror film) and only learned about the movie a few days ago.

I was already fully onboard with just the out there sci-fi type premise of birthing a younger self and trading consciousness weekly. That alone can make an interesting movie. Then it goes more and more body horror and it’s just…wow. I loved the over the top absurdity of…I guess the entire movie. But especially the dance scene, Sue just walking around on the street, and even her drinking a Diet Coke. 

And of course, the absolutely bonkers completely insane ending. I’m usually pretty good at guessing the ending especially of horror films having watched so many but I did not see this coming. Not like that. You know something is gonna go wrong but wow.

Demi Moore was stellar. Her best performance? And I didn’t know Dennis Quaid could chew scenery so good. About as good as he chewed them shrimps. 

Like another commenter said, my theater didn’t get up when the lights kicked on. Everyone just kinda sat there in silence for a bit. I hope this film picks up steam because it might be the best theater experience I’ve had with a horror movie or almost any movie in some time. It will be a shame if it doesn’t get the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Though I dunno who I would recommend this to. I feel like the average person would think I’m at best a sex pest by the middle or complete lunatic by the end. 

Question - did they share the same brain/memories at all? I thought not but it makes you think - kinda a raw deal if you don’t get to experience it at all. I suppose that’s the point, the aging movie star watching as a younger version supplants her. But if you don’t get the memories or ability to live through your younger self directly I don’t think many would take the substance. I know they must share something somehow due to the chicken dream though. 

Also I was CACKLING during the climax. And the over the top dance. I think it made a lot of people in my theater uncomfortable (both scenes really) and I and my wife had to be the only people openly laughing out loud. The cut to the child previously so excited sobbing and covered in blood made me laugh even more.

The first two acts are relatively sedate and take a while to get going but the sound design is phenomenal. Every act gets a sound which is amped up. Inserting a needle gets a squelch. Eating a shrimp gets a crunchy squelch. Even down to the shoes that Quaid character has have these steel heels so he just stomps down the hallway.

The third act is what's going to have everyone talking though. That's where the training wheels are fully off and it goes absolutely crazy. At one point it looks like everyone is at a GWAR concert with the spraying of blood into the audience.

There is commentary there about how women in this industry are highlighted, used and then spat out but I liked how it didn't preach about it, you could argue its almost quite reserved about it in truth. Small parts like the first time Sue walks down the street people step to the side for her to when Elizabeth does a day later and people are virtually bumping into her.

Demi Moore is phenomenal in this. I don't know if a body double was used at times and I don't think brave is the right word as it sounds almost patronising but she shows a lot. To have a camera pointed at you to show where you've aged and how things get lumpy and bumpy especially when you were known to be absolutely beautiful must have been hard for anyone to do. I wonder if the fact that it was a female director that Moore took this part on. The film works on another level too because the focal point is Moore, and her history of surgery and chasing youth.

I'm so glad to have seen this on a big screen. The only downside was how few people were there. I've read online of people being in packed cinemas where people were dry retching.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-09-22 21:41:38,"Watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it. 


The first 60 minutes are a fantastic drama/scifi adjacent take on womanhood; that alone was gripping. But there were cracks in the glamour. You could feel how defeated Elisabeth was. Demi acted her fucking ass off. 


Then the next 40 minutes manages to tell a gripping story of a woman who so desperately yearns for youth that she creates an entirely new person. Not a younger version of herself mind you, just a completely new person. A *better* person. Sue begins to ascend and realizes how “sad” Elisabeth is and grows disgusted of her, turning her into nothing more than cattle for her to take youth from. 


That alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just Hollywood. Also shout out to Coralie for having a real reason for showing off Sues body; it’s over the top for a reason and doesn’t feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror - it has purpose and meaning. 



Then you have the last 30 minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie I’ve ever seen. This is Society meets The Thing meets The Fly wrapped in a Barbie bow. The monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out Elisabeth head taped on. It’s just so ridiculous and absurd and it *works*. I’m sure there’s so many metaphors I’m missing, but I did think that the end where she’s literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period. Maybe that’s off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me. 



This movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, Demi Moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of American culture around women in general. 



I have no notes, nothing needed to be changed. 10/10. Easily one of the best horror movies of the past 20 years, an instant classic.",31,2024-09-19 13:24:29,"watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it

that alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just hollywood also shout out to coralie for having a real reason for showing off sues body its over the top for a reason and doesnt feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror  it has purpose and meaning 



then you have the last  minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie ive ever seen this is society meets the thing meets the fly wrapped in a barbie bow the monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out elisabeth head taped on its just so ridiculous and absurd and it works im sure theres so many metaphors im missing, but i did think that the end where shes literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period maybe thats off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me 



this movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, demi moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of american culture around women in general 



i have no notes, nothing needed to be changed  easily one of the best horror movies of the past  years, an instant classic"

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-10-02 10:19:53,"I have a hot take. The film wants us to feel heartbroken for Elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she can't help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change. The implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards. Judging by people's comments here (""no, honey, you're so beautiful!""), it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way. This troubles me. I think it's really the wrong message from this film. Elizabeth's core mental illness from the start was not her self-loathing; it was her self-obsession. Everything about her life was completely and utterly self-absorbed. (She makes Donald Trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison.) Trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful (or great) they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin. The thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasn't, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful; it was her need for human connection. And no amount of feeling beautiful and self-love would have lead her (and in fact did not lead her) to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be self-absorbed. The deeper moral that this film missed is: Being self-obsessed is unhealthy—a meaningful life comes from caring about others.",17,2024-09-19 13:24:29,"i have a hot take the film wants us to feel heartbroken for elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she cant help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change the implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards judging by peoples comments here no, honey, youre so beautiful, it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way this troubles me i think its really the wrong message from this film elizabeths core mental illness from the start was not her selfloathing it was her selfobsession everything about her life was completely and utterly selfabsorbed she makes donald trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful or great they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin the thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasnt, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful it was her need for human connection and no amount of feeling beautiful and selflove would have lead her and in fact did not lead her to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be selfabsorbed the deeper moral that this film missed is being selfobsessed is unhealthya meaningful life comes from caring about others"

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-09-24 09:23:19,"First the body horror and sound design was 10/10 for me, def one of the best experiences I’ve had seeing this film in theaters.

But my main gripe is that I don’t understand Elisabeth’s motivations AT ALL. Why did she go through this process when the end result has no benefits for her?

We establish that Elisabeth aligns her self worth with her looks so the logical through-line is that she’s willing to do anything to feel beautiful again, but the substance only makes a younger and better looking clone of her. Elisabeth does not experience anything Sue does, she’s basically in a coma whenever she trades places. So what’s the point?

I could maybe see that she would want to live vicariously through Sue like a parent might do, but Elisabeth resents Sue from the beginning and her presence only makes her feel worse about herself. 

Then I thought maybe she’s willing to do this since she needs money and can’t sustain her way of life since she’s too “old and unattractive” to do her previous job, but the film never makes a note that she’s struggling and even if she was fired from her job I assume she’s made enough over the years to live comfortably. 

Also, why was Elisabeth so distraught when Sue didn’t respect the balance and made Elisabeth age more by not switching in time? Elisabeth didn’t have friends or hobbies and when she was in control she stayed in the house all day. If she was already unhappy with the way she looked, then I’m not sure why becoming uglier would affect her so much.  

I’ve seen this type of idea put on screen before where a woman does something drastic to regain/attain beauty but then it goes wrong and the end result is that she’s worse off than where she started. If the point of this film was just to make a gory film spectacle like Terrifier that’s not meant to be analyzed or hard to think about, then at least make it shorter (the run time was kinda long). It would’ve had the same result and shock value imo. 

Someone please tell me if I’m missing something? I personally think character motivations such as this can’t really be swept under the rug since it’s the catalyst for literally everything that happens in the movie.

Tldr; Elisabeth’s motivations for taking the substance were unclear to me since none of the results seemed to benefit her in any meaningful way.",11,2024-09-19 13:24:29,"first the body horror and sound design was  for me, def one of the best experiences ive had seeing this film in theaters

From what I understand, she and Sue do not share a consciousness, based on the fact the other is always surprised when they “wake up” and see what the other was doing that week (ex: Elisabeth cooking all that food and leaving it the apt a mess). So it’s not like Elisabeth can bask in the glory of Sue’s success, since she has no mental or emotional connection to what she’s done to accomplish her achievements. So when the person on the phone tells Elisabeth she can quit, why wouldn’t she quit? It’d be like your friend getting all these accolades and living your dream and all you can do is watch from the sidelines, festering in your own jealousy. 

However, I am also unsure about the “sharing a conscious” thing as when Elisabeth is in the diner, that old man confronts her and she realizes it’s the young guy from the doctor’s office who gave her the info on the substance. The old man knows who she is and seems to have the memory of the young guy meeting her and giving her the substance info. So it seems the man shares a consciousness with his other?

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-10-17 06:04:30,"I loved this movie bc it’s making several different commentaries simultaneously. There’s the clear theme of the pressure women feel in our patriarchal society. There’s also just a thread that highlights the inner monologue of an insecure person, and the brutality and self-sabotage we all inflict upon ourselves. We’re our own worst enemy, right?

But the most poignant theme for me is the commentary on addiction. I’ve had struggles with that before, and to me, this was actually the main theme of the movie. The phone pinging with messages like “are you ok?” while Elizabeth sits in darkness was too real. Or when she’s laying in the shower, banging her head on the floor saying “stop, stop….” I bet a lot of people know exactly what that feeling is like. I know I do. Glad I’m not there anymore. 

The whole concept of someone recklessly stealing time and physical health from themself is all about addiction to me. The self-hatred, the isolation, and the diminishing returns all ring true. The idea of slowly killing yourself while pretending everything is fine is something most addicts can resonate with.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,2024-10-21 13:26:41,"I love your take! I'd like to add on to it if that's alright- not because I think you're wrong, but because I think it shows how the film can mean different things to different people depending on where their own insecurities/ traumas lie. I haven't struggled with addiction in quite the way you have, but I have struggled with eating disorders, and that's what the film reminded me of.

To me, the film was very about eating disorders- especially bulimia. She wants to stop, but she can't. She wants the 'good parts' without the 'bad parts'. A lot of people with bulimia view the binge-eating as the issue, and the purging as a natural consequence- part of recovery is learning to keep eating normally *even if you binge*. You have to love / accept yourself in all parts, even when you eat and you're fat and you're old and you hate it. But I don't think we ever see Sue eat, do we? We only see her exercise- we only see her *burn* calories, not take them in. Food is a source of horror to her, from the dream with the chicken leg to having to clean up after Elizabeth. *She* has no issues throwing the food out. To me, she represents purging/ restriction/ the goal of thinness, while Elizabeth represents bingeing/ losing control/ the body and habits that haunt you. 

Hearing them scream ""You have to control yourself!"", Elizabeth wanting to stop but being unable to, Elizabeth describing Sue as ""the only part of me that's loveable"", Sue calling Elizabeth fat and old, the binge-eating not even being properly *shown* because it's too shameful to acknowledge head-on, Sue having to 'deal with the consequences' of Elizabeth's binge eating, the constant reminders that you can stop at any time but you can't undo the damage you've already done, the teeth damage (common with purging), the fucked-up finger (can happen with purging), the desperate desire to split the part of you that is thin and pure and capable of control from the part that eats and wants and needs, Sue teling Elizabeth 'eat slowly' and failing to give her the nutrition she needs,  so much vomiting until she's throwing up her own *self*, both of them only achieving something close to happiness when Elizabeth is freed from her body completely...

There's something about how prescient yet universal the themes are, how perfectly the sci-fi examines those themes, how perfectly the cast is, and how effective it is both on an emotional, thematic level, but also as a gonzo, over the top, gleefully distasteful B movie. It feels like a new pillar of body horror that we'll talk about in the same context as The Thing and The Fly.

It's also the rare horror movie that swings bigger and bigger all the way to the end. It really goes for it, and whether or not you think it's fully successful, you can't deny the ambition and execution and the sheer spectacle of it.

Also, as many have already pointed out, the shrimp scene made me actually look away. The rest of the film was nightmarish and disgusting, but the shrimps were the worst for me by far lol",8,2024-09-22 21:41:32,"fucking loved it it feels like a classic theres something about how prescient yet universal the themes are, how perfectly the scifi examines those themes, how perfectly the cast is, and how effective it is both on an emotional, thematic level, but also as a gonzo, over the top, gleefully distasteful b movie it feels like a new pillar of body horror that well talk about in the same context as the thing and the fly

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

Just finish seeing it a half hour ago in the theater.  My my initial thoughts: 

Holy god. 
One of the years best, easily. But holy god.

- so many Kubrick references and homages, as well as DePalma and Lynch. And Cronenberg . Both Senior and junior. Even a little Billy Wilder.

- I hope Demi Moore gets recognized for an absolutely fearless performance.

- Best make up and special effects - much of it had to have been practical - I've seen this year.

- holy god

- what is it with French directors and surreal, absurdist body horror? Feels very much in the spirit of Titane.

- the last 30 minutes are fucking wild.",1,2024-09-22 21:41:32,"

I think the term Cronenbergian is used a bit too much in regards to body horror, but the satirical style of this really reminded me of the likes of Crash and Videodrome, particularly in regards to the growing prosthetics and makeup. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were both great, although Dennis Quaid stole the show in his scenes. 

There’s a real conflict of the horror and humour at times - the cooking/ chat show scene walks the thin line between the two perfectly.

The impossible beauty standards that become internalised, the male gaze and misogyny, fear of ageing and the loss of identity when losing your career due to nothing other than being seen as too old, lack of self-confidence in your value beyond how you look, the consequences brought to your later self by selfish choices and not caring for the impact or for your future wellbeing, the fear of abandonment and desperate need to be loved … and that’s just what hit a personal note, let alone the rest!

(And one element I’ve not seen discussed yet is that of the role of Elizabeth as the “mother”, and very much like the pushy beauty pageant moms that make their kids live out what they never could or to relive their glory days through them.) 

I was told by my partner this was a “body horror comedy”, and I went in without knowing anything else about it. I am not a fan of horror, and wouldn’t choose to watch anything that makes me too squeamish. My fingers were over my eyes several times 🙈 I said to my partner, “if this is a comedy just like Barbarian was a thriller, you’re in trouble” 😂 I’ve gotta say as disturbed as I was by it in many parts, it is incredibly thought provoking.

As many have said, The Substance isn't concerned with subtlety or nuance.  It's got one point to make, a sledgehammer and some inspired body horror.

There are obvious comparisons that can be made, but the one I'm stuck on is Under the Skin. I think they share a lot of the same DNA - bold, bonkers, divisive and heavily stylised. I love to rewatch Under the Skin though. It speaks to me in a way that The Substance didn't. 

I appreciated the satire but I don't know how successful it was. It's a film about the male gaze but it never subverts that - it's just very male gazey. It wants to satirise figures like Harvey Weinstein and Vince McMahon, but Harvey gets no comeuppance, instead he gets a lot of laughs. It wants to satirise society's insane reactions to women aging but turns Demi Moore into a monstrous hag who becomes insanely jealous of a younger woman's success and then dies horrifically.

I'm not a guy who particularly cares about morals in media, but imo the message of the film conflicts somehow with how it is described in the reviews: in the narrative world the substance can be used indefinetly if applied as prescribed (""maintaining the balance""), a fact which avoids an honest reckoning with the ultimate futility of maintaining immortal beauty/control of bodily functions. so it boils down to the following: the failings of the users is an individual fault, and the elizabeth/sue monstrosity in the grand finale is an object of ridicule. - so I think the film somehow fails in this regard. with it's handling of topics of sexism, ageism in the industry, body shame, reproduction etc the movie is somehow clustered and all over the place, a lot of cool ideas and allegories half-exposed and discussed. - this out of the way: I think the movie is great at conveying the bodily horror technically, it's male gazing zooms on frantically swinging hips and oozing wounds. Moore's performance during the first half (when the tone of the movie strikes a better balance between the comic and the tragic) is superb - contrast it to the scene where she cooks and watches Sue in the tv, where the ""comedic"" and audience distance took way overhand imo. qualley's performance is great too, but I quickly got fed up with the shots on her - the technical critique of the male gaze gets repetetive quite fast imo. really enjoyed the sound.

The most disturbing scenes are not the violent or body horror ones which are not even that intense, but the fear of ageing and the obsession we have for the passing of time, opportunities, fame/exposure and our past selves. The scenes where Demi looks in the mirror and then compares herself to Sue and constantly touches up her make up and her outfit are so heavy and everybody I think can relate, especially people past 25 who are starting to see the signs of ageing and the first changes in their appearance, men AND women.

The moments where she is hopeful and then everything turns for the worst well represents the risks and foolish things people are willing to take and do to look young. And it can be anything: drugs, diet, digital filters, fillers, surgery, fake teeth, fashion choices...

I hoped the feminist elements wouldn't be as pronounced as I think this is, in different ways, a universal experience especially in our modern social media mediated times. But the meta element of an ageing celebrity played by someone who was recently scrutinized for her facial procedures and looks was also a boss move on Demi's part.

Another detail that I found disturbing was the lack of information provided with the substance: it really captures today's beauty market so well with tons of energy based and at home devices and products that are sold with little care and scientific studies and people use them with little guidance and knowledge... a growing phenomenon is severe facial fat loss induced by microcurrent, lasers and radiofrequency devices. This was captured flawlessly in how Elizabeth jumps on The Substance with little hesitation and little care for the whole process, even when things starts getting weird. And the meth addict symptoms were poignant as well.

As for the finale, I loved the camp ending, it helps balance the uneasiness of the central/later part of the movie but I guess there were a couple of other directions the movie could have gone and explored so even if it is not a masterful scene per se, it was able to surprise me. But it was a fun scene that clearly pays homage to a cult classic and gives a strong statement about how, at least in hollywood but in modern times in general, the ""audience"" is what feeds this narrative and this obsession for beauty and youth, so everybody is guilty in the end and the whole splatter thing is a release of all the nasty emotions embodied by the monster.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,2024-10-09 16:55:14,"This is if Cronenberg, Lynch and Verhoeven made a movie but more visually striking than Refn. This movie is the definition of unapologetic. I was not ready for how much everything escalated by the end, and the movie was not shy or subtle about the points it was making. I was blown away by the starking visual contrast between ""beauty"" and ""ugliness"" and yet the movie made them both gross and sexual at the same time to ultimately expose us, the viewers, for our unhealthy gaze.

The substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves. The paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless. This is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm. We wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder! It shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions. We are covered in our own blood. The walls are covered in blood.

Yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody. Every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character. We see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain.

Our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too. And she does not hold back. Yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd. The comedy in this movie is absolute gold. The villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious. The absurdity of this movie is so refreshing.

In terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate. It is never stagnant, but it's also not in a rush. After all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage.

This is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped. My only note would be I wish they didn't do the hamfisted voice overs at the end. I know most viewers would have missed that point. But I don't think it would have taken away from the movie. Maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as Easter eggs for the second watch. Really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience. 9.8/10.

P.S. I gotta say while watching this I kept thinking about the barbie movie. Every safe choice, absurd self important and alienating point barbie made, this movie undid!

the substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves the paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless this is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm we wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder it shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions we are covered in our own blood the walls are covered in blood

yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character we see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain

our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too and she does not hold back yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd the comedy in this movie is absolute gold the villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious the absurdity of this movie is so refreshing

in terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate it is never stagnant, but its also not in a rush after all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage

this is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped my only note would be i wish they didnt do the hamfisted voice overs at the end i know most viewers would have missed that point but i dont think it would have taken away from the movie maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as easter eggs for the second watch really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience 

ps i gotta say while watching this i kept thinking about the barbie movie every safe choice, absurd self important and alienating point barbie made, this movie undid i loved this movie with the same energy i hated the barbie"

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,2024-09-21 23:59:34,"Just saw it today, and wow, I thought it was brilliant, though some in my audience seemed to think it was over the top, especially by the end. To me, I've never seen a movie quite like this, and mad props to Fargeat for executing something so personal with such a high level of artistry and confidence and Moore and Qualley for allowing themselves to be so emotionally and physically vulnerable to put this on screen. For as darkly funny as much of this movie is, it's really got a big emotional heft, and Moore carries a lot of that with her performance and walks the balance of the emotional part and the absurdist black comedy so well. It can be a tough watch, not just because of the gore really, but honestly because Moore's character almost feels like she's at war with herself. Her character's self-hatred and self-abnegation is just crushing to watch on screen. In a lot of ways, the movie feels so much like a psychological horror movie as well before it goes full on body horror extravaganza in the final act. I really think that is because we are so pulled into the interiority of Elizabeth/Sue, to the point that the movie even switches to their first person perspective in several instances. 

I personally loved the ending; for me, it was like pulling the release on a valve and just releasing the pressure on all these heavy emotions and ideas building throughout the movie and almost was like a relief. Oddly enough, I actually found the ending to be the least nauseating; it was just so outlandish that it just kinda became hysterical and full-on satire at that point. The movie up to that point just has this heaviness and tension to it because you really do feel sorrowful for what Moore's character is experiencing; the final sequence just feels like one giant fuck you and condemnation to the whole hollywood culture around youth and beauty and like the ultimate way to ridicule it.

The first 2/3 of the movie definitely had my stomach churning at certain points (surprisingly the worst being watching Dennis Quaid eat shrimp). A lot of the food stuff in particular was just so nasty to me. I think people will be surprised about the moments in this movie that are emotionally disturbing and anxiety-inducing. Moore's scene in front of the mirror where she just kept going back actually made me so anxious because the self-doubt and emotional turmoil was so relatable, and you can feel the desperation and sadness she is going through. The body switch sequences were almost clinical and I felt like it just tapped into all these anxieties and fears around watching our bodies deteriorate and being poked and prodded by doctors as we get older. And Qualley's dance sequences were just so uncomfortable with the music and the camera movements. I was just really amazed how this movie almost felt like it was breathing through the screen with a lot of the textures and sounds. The sound, set design and makeup are just superb and just make this film such a sickening joy to watch. 

Maybe it's hyperbole, but to me it really feels like one of the most unique visions I've seen in a film in a long time.

Also as one of the central characters’ grows more famous there may be occasional moments of paparazzi-like camera flashes, although these are somewhat infrequent. The BBFC does have a photosensitivity warning on its website for the film though, which is usually a fairly good indicator.

Not sure if it’d have a similar effect, but there’s also some pretty rapid editing here and there. A car crash scene early on and also during scenes where a fitness/ workout show is being filmed (actually may also be some flashing lights as part of this). Third act in general also might have combinations of both due to some of the events and settings, where the combination of things might just make everything seem that bit more intense(?), but obviously no spoilers. 

Overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there. I think generally though, if you’ve seen the trailer in the cinema (which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts) that might give you a good indication of what some of the film’s sequences might be like?

overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there i think generally though, if youve seen the trailer in the cinema which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts that might give you a good indication of what some of the films sequences might be like apologies if this spiel is completely unhelpful, especially as it kind of summarises as an overrambly i dont know"

I know it’s a satirical, humorous, and overt message about aging, beauty standards, and the male gaze but despite the campy tone at times I actually found this movie to be quite sad at its heart.

Demi Moore hasn’t been in many projects in years and is now in her early 60s. For her to do this indie left of center French horror film when she doesn’t have to—to be this aging character that had been put out to pasture—i just found her performance really courageous and vulnerable. 

The scenes with her alone as Elizabeth were heart breaking to me especially when she stands her date up because of her self hatred towards her appearance. And how she falls further into isolation and depression due to her compare/despair mentality and how invisible and ugly she perceives she is. I actually teared up at times because I saw myself in certain parts. Like how many times I’ve changed clothes before I date, looking in the mirror multiple times, eating junk when I’ve felt sad, etc. 

I think this movie is a great metaphor about self-hatred, how it leads to addiction, and the distortions and deformations both those things cause when we don’t have a sense of self that is free from the hostile unrealistic standards of society.",59,2024-09-10 10:18:59,"really great film cant stop thinking about it

The more I think about it the more I appreciate it. It just covers off so many different genres and elements in one movie - Hollywood satire, critique of beauty standards, commentary on aging in the media, how women see themselves as the approach 50, wild body-horror, dissection of misogyny, takedown of celebrity, black comedy.... it's many things.

the more i think about it the more i appreciate it it just covers off so many different genres and elements in one movie  hollywood satire, critique of beauty standards, commentary on aging in the media, how women see themselves as the approach , wild bodyhorror, dissection of misogyny, takedown of celebrity, black comedy its many things

This was probably the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years. The cinematography was beautiful. The internal struggle in Elizabeth was heartbreaking and I also related to Sue. The clear commentary on agism, the beauty standard, plastic surgery and the desperate clawing for youth was not lost on me. 

But what really made me sad in the activation stage was how Sue just left Elizabeth on the bathroom floor. Didn't close her eyes. Didn't try to move her to a more comfortable position. Didn't try to set up a cot or something for her. It was like the self hatred was palpable from the beginning. 

My only question was - they were one - but did they really remember each other's experiences? When the consciousness was being shifted back and forth between bodies, did Sue have the mindset of a 20 year old? Or was Sue/Elizabeth still a 50 year old consciousness who was desperate to be in a 20 year old body? Was that the self-hatred aspect as well? Or even just an agism of the self?

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,2024-10-04 15:28:47,"I thought it was very good commentary on body dysmorphia and addiction. I thought the film was very expertly crafted and kind of realistic in terms of how the world looks when you are dealing with those things. The way that half of the movie takes place in her bathroom, the way she always managed to keep it hidden, always closing the door just in time before anyone else can see her switch, etc just hit really hard. I was half expecting a plot twist that her original body was never really altering and this whole time she was just imagining herself like that. I actually kind of liked the ending though, or at least I can’t think of a more powerful way they could have ended it— it would have been too easy if she killed Sue and lived the rest of her life as a hermit, or if she would have killed herself which I think ironically would have been too happy of an ending. The way I interpreted it was that she could have maintained a balance between Sue and Elisabeth and it would have all been okay, but she didn’t have the willpower to do so because of how powerful the addiction and shame spiral was— she no longer cared about protecting her body, she just wanted to stay high on Sue until it destroyed her body to the point of no return. Her new lifestyle was unsustainable, and because of that she now had to live with the consequences. 

All else aside, it was also very campy and slay. Very very well shot and very good soundtrack. It was very uncomfortable to sit through in the sense that it shook me to my core.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,2024-10-05 16:36:07,"I absolutely love this movie. It’s comedic, disturbing, cheesy and over the top in all of the best ways, and yet so relatable at the same time with themes of self criticism and self love. I also picked up on references to substance abuse - I don’t think that’s where the movie title came from or anything of the sort, that’d be too direct and obvious. I’m in recovery myself so maybe it’s just the way my brain works lol but the way she’d have to RUN to the bathroom to extract more time from/for herself (sort of like a “fix”) and to keep from getting sick reminded me of that, especially when she did it in order to be able to perform. 

I’m typically not one for mixing comedy and horror but this one did it perfectly; certain moments that would usually make me laugh actually made me uncomfortable and I just sat there with my hand over my mouth like “what. the. fuck.” Some parts did make me laugh though which was clearly the intention. 

Demi’s performance in this is absolutely unreal. I don’t remember her being that good?? The cooking scene while she’s watching the interview is gorgeously disgusting, infuriating and hilarious. I forgot for a minute that I WASN’T watching Jessica Lange in AHS. I started to really feel for her as the movie progressed and she began to hate both (all?) versions of herself more and more. I think a lot of people can relate to the mirror makeup scene, followed by what I interpreted as a depressive episode with isolating, ditching plans, not taking care of yourself; in other scenes also the overeating, increasingly negative self talk, LOT of mental health and external/internal validation themes. When Elisabeth and Sue started treating each other like shit, saying really terrible things and literally fighting “each other” (fighting herself), I was like “well that’s not very good positive self talk.” And the bells went off when I realized it’s not far off from how I sometimes talk to myself.

But I ended up watching it. half-way through I felt it was so bad it was good and by the end I saw cult classic to be. It reminded me of a mix between the movie Looker (1981) and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Carrie (1976) (won't say why so I don't give spoilers away and a bit pressed for time). I think the movie is an omen to the rising vapid influencers and similar who are doing just about anything to beautiful and relevant. It was symbolic of how we have a fight we being authentic and yet having everything we think is valuable such as youth and beauty but those things don't last and are missing something deeper. In the end it points how we've lost the way and destroy ourselves to the point of being like a cancer that nobody wants. The thing is all present may condemn and yet they'd probably all be guilty of the same given the chance.

Throw in some Cronenbergian body-horror and a style reminiscent of Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream for good measure.

Bravo to the filmmaker and the actors - they really put themselves out there. You're going to feel something by the end of the movie, which isn't something I can say about most horror films.

For all the over-the-top sexuality and gore, this is an extremely sad movie.

Fantastic cinematography and sound design hindered by a derivative plot. It felt like it was trying to do what black Swan did, except the themes of anorexia and ocd are replaced by themes of aging and, well, Hollywood. I really enjoyed the body horror segments but couldn't really get behind the pathos, especially considering how it felt like a more shallow version of Black Swan.

In my showing the film was preceeded by a trailer for A Different Man starring Adam Pearson, an actor with elefantitis. This kept playing in my mind during the final scene and what was supposed to portay a physical representation of the pain of Moore's character felt like a mockery. Perhaps this was a case of bad timing or perhaps it said something about us as an audience. I found this quite fascinating and it made me question my own prejudices in a way that was definitely not intended.

The Fly (1988) For the Body horror, SFX makeup, and the heart-wrenching internal plea towards the end of:"" Please just kill me."" The Fly also just has these moments of being so poignant. It's ugly and beautiful all at once. Its like you could understand the cast and the decisions they make. Very similar to The Substance 

Titane (2022) Very bizarre scenes, brutal self-harm, and not being quite human and the film leaves you with the feeling of what did I just watch? 

Brand New Cherry Flavor (2021) The substance and BNCF have this weird black magic, unbelievable body contortion, and lack of explanation of how and what is happening. A similar theme of show business and desperation to make ""It"" happen. Lost of explicit sexual and just disturbing imagery as well. And lastly, something very wrong with the protagonist 

Possessor (2020) This to me has the closest resemblance to the substance to me. It is also a sci-fi, depicting a a swap of consciousness with another and the effects of it after leading into madness. Instead of seeking fame and beauty, it is for job security. (Brandon Cronenberg David Cronenberg's son). Has a Blade intro amount of blood throughout the film. It is a slow burn but boy, when it's lit it's an inferno. Very unnerving 

The Stuff (1985) This movie always is very similar to substance only it is more alien than ""Home grown by good ole humans."" The stuff truly is what it is. Just a blob, really. However this film portraits the uncanny and campy valley the substance had and most definitely showed towards the end. 

  
Side notes: Margaret Qualley looks just like Emily Denato. Is that just me? Like wtf 

The ending credits of the soundtrack have me in a chokehold, I can't stop listening halp

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,2024-10-22 11:38:26,"I honestly thought it was quite a poor film. Yes, I get the undertones of Hollywood - American culture in general - always wanting younger and prettier 'next big thing', but who doesn't know that? We all know that when a woman reaches a certain age, the establishment (across the board, not just Hollywood) ousts them and brings in someone younger (why do you think that news anchors all look like plastic-skinned androids?). We know this! This film isn't anything deep or meaningful, or saying something that hasn't been highlighted a million times before... Is that the selling point of this movie and what it is hinging on? And, of course in today's world, the males are the biggest, most disgusting and most evil caricatures of a real person. Do you not think that this narrative is getting old? Planting seeds in young peoples' minds that all men are 'evil' is not healthy and leads to a confused outlook on life, based on a half-truth and today's narrative. That is not a good thing.

Back to the culture: young woman feel the pressure of an impossible perfection - again mainly thanks to America  -  but is it not a tad self-obsessed and childish, as an adult, to still be hung up on 'being young'?
Plastic surgery is horrific in of itself - weird looking, moulded cat people - and if that is a theme, then it should have pointed in that direction. If anything, the underlying story should be about the evils of going under the knife and the mindset that brought a person to that point, with the protagonist realising that they are their own version of perfect, just as themselves. 

Now for the movie itself: the story was nonsense. It couldn't stick to its own narrative and if anything, Sue was an entirely different person from Liz, like they weren't at all connected. It didn't make sense. Then, Sue wanting to abuse then kill her old self - 'the Matrix' - surely knowing that if she does, she'll also die. Surely she knew that. It's stupid. Was it a commentary or a gross-out slapstick comedy? It was all over the place.

The third act. Jebus wept. Talk about being out-of-place. Where did that come from? The gore was more extreme than a b-movie classic, but again, stupid (how much blood does a person have?). Was the film wanting us to think about the 'themes' or be grossed-out? Sad or enjoying the gore? Look for meaning or switch-off?

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,2024-09-21 11:36:31,"As a man in the healthcare and beauty industry: I just watched it,  didn't feel grossed out but rather more sympathetic to young and older women out here. Even the men. Also shows the egotistical women nowadays. I'm an open-minded, young gentleman. Nothing like the creepy seafood french cuisine lunatics we have running the fashion and beauty industry. You're all beautiful in your own way. 
Beauty treatments are to enhance your self image, not change it to the point that now, you're another person. It can backfire with the psychological aspect, where one can end up hating their old self, become addicted to the newer, more youthful self. We all want to be loved and appreciated by others. 

Now for the women nowadays. This term feminism is not understood by majority of women today. Creepy men are hated by gentlemen and women. Anyway, feminism has made women egotistical. They think their beauty can run the show, but in fact it's the same fitness routine. She got the job, never changed her routine yet no one noticed and preferred the young woman except the one weird nerdy guy that always liked her the way she is. Apart from the one man,   the legacy of old Elizabeth disappeared in an instant. All spoken out of hatred, by her newer self, Sue. 
My warning to all, especially extreme feminists. Respect the gentlemen, don't put them down just because they're not model looking. Oh he's 6ft, that's perfect. Shorter, ignore him and let him suffer. Oh, he's not got a great face, ewww let him suffer. So, this mentality creates more evil men, joining the shareholders group and they'll profit from your beauty and you'll turn into puppets instead. Don't become a monsto and end up looking like a mess. Respect great men. Respect great women. We all have our flaws, don't focus too much and live your life. Elizabeth was never in a relationship, Sue was abusing her looks to get the natural tall, model men. For fun. Yet it's only those men unfortunately portrayed as only caring for sex. Not everyone revs the pedal and fuels their ego,  pictured as the male Sue of today. 

Men don't put make up or utilise certain beauty treatments. Nothing wrong with beauty treatments, it's a tool to enhance, not to change.  What we do as men, is accept our heights, good 6ft or not so good (judged by both Elizabeth and Sue's of the world), accept our male genetics despite all the negativity from women like Sue and Elizabeth. Both are one. Men are put down constantly. 
So this film in my perspective, is fuelling bad feminism and once again, not realising all the actual hard work us guys have to put up with. Financially lacking, no woman wants you. No height, women (even the short women apparantly deserve the height difference lol) hate you. No muscles, skinny,  again no woman wants you. But for men outside of the film industry, we all appreciate you, young or old. Its preferences and being open minded. If you find it ewww, don't tell them they're eww, it's soul destroying. 
Don't be that old man following Elizabeth, embrace your beauty. Beauty you can't change. We can lose weight, remove wrinkles under our eyes, put make-up on to enhance, apply creams to enhance your youthful skin and maintain them. But you can't change genetics. Height is the  one thing we can't change. Sue was called little or small, can't recollect. But the creepy seafood CEO called her small, despite her being the same height as him. Sue playing with her looks so the neighbour doesn't complain, again something weak men fall for. 

So, don't be Elizabeth and Sue, in personality. Also, don't be too crazy that you see yourself as unlovable. That goes for men as well. I just found out that the woman behind this fantastic film, is a feminist. This shows, and i need to address this as no one pointed this out and saw it in her viewpoint. No one wants to acknowledge the point of view of open minded men like myself who understand this, although i love seafood...

Some movies are not for everyone, and that's what's great about it.
I absolutely loved the movie, and as a woman, I weirdly got very attached to the main character.
Saw one of the posts where a dad says that his daughter got attached also and yes!!! I absolutely can understand it
Why I think it's cinema worthy?(Even though it doesn't matter)
The aesthetics, the music, the metaphors, the actors and their acting, the originality, the complexity, the heaviness of the movie, the randomness and also the comedy.
I said it was funny how some people said it's puerile because watching the movie I thought about the men in the movie are puerile and kinda stupid.

This is a film about the female experience from youth to motherhood, ageism, and beyond. It’s about loving yourself and hating yourself. And the destruction that comes from the latter.

I’d also say it’s not an ‘all men are evil’ film, but it does point out the obvious inequalities that still exist for women in any walk of life that don’t for men. A systematic issue that still exists whether we like it or not and is proven widely (ahem gender pay gaps).

This is a film about the experience of women. Granted not all women. But many of us. 

From medical neglect, impossible beauty standards, and misogyny. 

The film is crass, gory and ridiculous yes. It’s got B movie vibes (that i personally loved). 

For me it told a bizarre-but truthful story of what it’s like to be a woman. It’s bloody, scary, complicated, competitive and sometimes fucking depressing (especially when someone tells you to smile more cos you’re pretty).

What is the message? Demi Moore who at 60 still looks better than most and who made her entire career on looking hot, because she never was much of an actress and she's a millionaire is questioning why she doesn't get cast anymore that much? I'm not really seeing how the business did her bad when she got 20 million I think, the then highest salary for any woman, for Striptease which was sold only on her nudity and hotness. So basically the reality is, if you're young and hot and not much of an actress, when you start getting older, Hollywood and showbiz moves on. I don't see this happening to people like Jodie Foster, Cate Blanchett, etc., maybe because they actually are good? Not sure how that's something evil.

Get Out, Black Swan, The Sixth Sense, Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist, The Omen, Misery, Rosemary’s Baby, Carrie, The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth, Sweeney Todd and Jaws all were heavily nominated or even won big at the Oscars. 

But most of those tend to have pretty subdued performances as opposed to Malignant style acting. 

It’s easy to say the academy doesn’t like horror but horror has won best picture multiple times. I think it’s more that larger than life and borderline campy horror movies are more discriminated against. Pearl, Hereditary, The Babadook, Us, The Shining and Midsommar all deserved acting noms but all those movies had actors hamming it up and I think that’s the bigger thread connecting them than just the academy not liking horror.

My take is that it is meant to view the transformation as a metaphore for cosmetic surgery - creating a split personality - one that is adored for their beauty and youth, people starting to treat you differently than before (lookism). And then there is another one, the old one, knowing that it is still same person behind the facade, with some of the same problems than before, eating disorders, realising that the new look is not all-transformative, even starting to hate the new person for being fake, fearing for the future look as the aging is inevitable. And when another cosmetic surgery (another transformation) is needed, the visual outcome may not be a desired one and there are only hints of the original person left, the rest is just a mess of flesh, out of proportion, out of place even.

All she did was create a carbon copy of her selfish self but younger, better looking, and with a younger, more devil, may care attitude. When the New Year's opportunity came up, it was what she always dreamed, so she was gonna have it come hell or high water. It was her ultimate dream.

Instead of just accepting that we all get older and when our younger year's are behind it and our curtain comes closer to being drawn she got given an option. She didn't follow the rules and well the film shows u when someone with a narcissistic individual who displays sociopathic tendencies. Though ironically, she was not the best candidate.

Again, this is all guesswork on my part, but it seems a logical conclusion to the trailer and the way the film looked like it could play out.

Another poster made a brilliant analysis on cosmetic surgery and the substance and again looking to continue to drain that fountain of youth long after its run dry. 

I saw Elizabeth as a self centred, narcissistic individual who's only reason for living was herself and her dreams and when she didn't achieve them she saw the cheat code and grabbed it. But unfortunately the old saying cheaters never prosper came back to haunt her.

The fact that the video and voice kept saying you are one interested me because I thought ironically the substance seemed a lot to me like power it should never be given to people who seek and and those willing to say no would probably have more of the mindset to use the substance properly but maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe the substance is always doomed for failure regardless of who takes it because its hardcoded in most of humanity to be selfish and take more than what's needed especially when it's offered on a platter.

I was always that kid. If u told me to do something, I'd do the complete opposite 😆 🤣 and I'm 40 now, and I haven't changed and don't plan on starting yet. I do believe as a society we are all far too obsessed with beauty and pretty people when in actuality some of the most attractive people I've met have turned out to be some of the most boring people I ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Whether there's a correlation between highly attractive people say not having to work as hard as the rest of us I dunno but it's a sound theory. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that every attractive person has the personality of a goldfish but some of the most amazing people I've ever met certainly weren't 8's or 9's in the beauty department lol 😆 

It's kinda like the analogy of rich people never having to have worked for anything and always being given everything so easily. Imo the struggle is what builds character and manners too I might add again some of the wealthiest people I've met have turned out to be rude and obnoxious where as people from poorer backgrounds who have had to scratch and claw for everything they've earned have turned out to be some of the nicest, kindest most caring and interesting people I've come across.

thank you for your replies, and i hope both u and your bf have a lovely weekend "

My favourite 2 parts are where >!firstly, she takes the peyote and beer can and patches herself back up. Yeah, it's a bit far-fetched surviving the fall, etc, but looking for a deeper meaning I took the cave to represent possibly that she hadn't survived and that was her descent into the inferno especially with the fire etc. But then waking up with the brand, the fact that her flesh now belonged to the devil, maybe I dunno its fun to ponder these things. Secondly, I like the scene where there both messed up at the end blood everywhere. Visibly against the tiles and floor, it's striking, but I don't know if when he slips if that was intentional, but it looked pretty real and glad they kept it in. I love what he does with the cling film or saran wrap for our us cousin's. Digging into that scene and how it plays out I interpreted it as she had to struggle so now it's his turn so that's why she takes her time with him and let's the fear build in him until its her time to strike and exact her Vengeance making her Revenge complete.

Damn, that sucks. For me, that scene where Elisabeth (Demi Moore) is preparing for her date and grows frustrated and more hateful towards her own appearance and self was so earnest and devastating. I understand self-hate all too well, so I found her to be incredibly tragic. Actually, it might be good that you don’t relate xD

I think this movie is also similar to Evil Dead, in that it really works if you vibe with it. But that’s entirely subjective and up to the viewer’s individual taste. If you don’t, then you don’t.

I thought it was going to see some sci-fi type movie where someone being injected with the substance would gain some mind powers or something.

Anyway, I took the wife, who hates anything gory btw, I cant her to watch any horrors or action movies with gore... Anyway, I was lost for words how entertaining this movie was. It was off the charts haha.

Story line is a bit mehhh but the movie content is just incredible. And its one of those movies that makes you really think about the perspectives of the writes of the movie plot/scenes.

I honestly think this movie is a proper art piece! 10/10

**SPOILER ALERT........... STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT YET..............**

My take on it is that she was hating herself getting older, she was then fired from her job and was to be replaced with someone younger and more beautiful making her hate herself even more.

Wishing she could be a younger version of herself again consumed her and took over her thoughts and then she was involved in the accident.

The accident put her in a state between life and death or she was in a coma.... Her thoughts was the plot of the remainder of the movie where they became uglier and uglier resulting in the monster at the end.

Ultimately this movie was a subjective art piece aimed at women who cant handle losing their youth and young beauty and do whatever they can to retain it, in some cases turning into a monster after many rounds of surgeries or injections or whatever.

The man on the other end of the phone tells her many times she can stop and be her current self at any time with no further damage.

I’ve seen some people critique the last act after Monstro Elisue looks in the mirror as ‘unnecessary’ but I feel it is what makes the film special and arguably a ‘masterclass’. As Monstro Elisue, Elisabeth finally embraces her appearance fully, and heads back to the NYE taping and enters the stage with a finally unrestrained glee, only to be ridiculed and attacked by the crowd, who represent society and also us, the literal audience, and our infatuation with impossible beauty standards. After an entire movie of trying to become beautiful again, she is finally content with herself, despite the crowd’s horror, and she thwarts the audience and their visceral reaction to her appearance by dousing them in absolutely insane amounts of explosive blood and gore, bathing them in it, before she finally settles onto her star on the walk of fame with a smile on her face.

The most brilliant aspects to me were this: she forced the viewer to see things from the aspect of the typical “male gaze,” and to spice it up a bit it was interjected with close ups of Dennis Quaids mouth eating shrimp. The lips are the asshole are made of the same type of skin. Lots of close up ass and taint shots. The message? Ass and hole. Tiny shrimp going in also isn’t lost on me.

Until that I thought that Sue wasn't actually Elisabeth, like they didn't share the same soul so to speak, and that she was essentially a clone. I thought that had to be the case when Sue was able to wake up and exist alongside her before killing her. Then Monstro Elisasue happens and you see that they are now literally ""one"" physically, but they put on the Elisabeth mask and apply lipstick like Elisabeth had earlier, which seemed weird at first because Sue just killed her, why would she opt to look like Elisabeth instead of herself?

I'll need to rewatch but I think that's an interesting interpretation, especially considering how it all went down right after she decided to not go through with the termination. Honestly as I write this I could genuinely see everything after that being somewhat of a dream sequence or metaphor or something.

She thought she looked hideous and bombed on the show in front of everyone, and the boos of the audience felt like an assault.

I'm gonna get downvoted for this, cause apparently everyone online loves this movie - but how?   
This is the most predictable movie (until the last 10%) I've seen in years. Really, from a single line you could see exactly how the plot would go.   >!Liz is fired from her job? Oh, let me guess who will take it and be extremely popular. Substance can be misused? Gee, I wonder what would happen! It's been so obvious Sue would misuse the substance, cause she'd want more, and Liz would suffer from it, at first not **that** much (the finger), but then things would escalate to an extreme degree.!< I don't mean to sound like a douche, but I'm genuinely asking - what is creative here in your opinion? What part in the plot surprised you except for maybe the ending?       
The ending, IDK, maybe is creative, but it borderlines on autoparody (>!""I'm not a monster! It's still me!""!< are you fucking serious, this got golden palm for the script?)   
Not to mention the plot holes, like Sue having master engineering skills (the building part) for no reason whatsoever...   
   
But predictability is not the biggest concern of the movie. It's how the director thinks all her viewers are idiots and is extremely unsubtle with her message (which is kinda obvious, to begin with). Did we really need to have it shown on multiple people that Liz and Sue are treated differently, cause one is old, and the other is young and beautiful? Yeah, I got the message the first time.

Demi Moore to Be Honored in France Ahead of 'The Substance's' Premiere,1730686109.0,2024-11-04 09:26:19,"I think you’re confusing predictability with dramatic irony. The movie lays out the rules VERY CLEARLY for us multiple times, and each time we know in the back of our heads that *of course* those rules are going to be broken. The movie knows that we know that. Our basic human sympathy that leads us to not want to see horrific shit happen to a good person creates a sense of impending dread. It’s a tale of self-destruction through the lens of societal expectations. 

For me, the real surprise of the movie was the contradictory nature of what we were told was meant to be happening vs what was actually happening vis-a-vis the substance itself. One of the FREQUENTLY REPEATED lines is REMEMBER: YOU ARE ONE. But… it feels very clear from early on that Elizabeth and Sue are *not* the same person. It really doesn’t seem like Elizabeth is piloting Sue. To me, that’s a narrative surprise. That’s artful intention. 

I think that THE SUBSTANCE is a movie that is very loud and obvious on purpose (it’s a dark comedy after all, and the obviousness is part of its sense of humor) but also has the ability to say things quietly and with nuance at the same time. 

Also Sue being able to build a secret room is not a plot hole. The movie is, once again, a comedy. The fact that she’s wearing the same hot girl booty shorts that she always does but just puts on some safety glasses for that scene is, in my opinion, fucking hilarious.",15,2024-11-04 02:08:29,"i think youre confusing predictability with dramatic irony the movie lays out the rules very clearly for us multiple times, and each time we know in the back of our heads that of course those rules are going to be broken the movie knows that we know that our basic human sympathy that leads us to not want to see horrific shit happen to a good person creates a sense of impending dread its a tale of selfdestruction through the lens of societal expectations

Demi Moore to Be Honored in France Ahead of 'The Substance's' Premiere,1730686109.0,2024-11-04 10:17:58,"I do see your point, but yet again - if the movie is obvious and it knows it's obvious, I don't find it creative.  
The hidden room part might have been comedic, I guess the joke didn't work for me. But you'd be surprised how lots of people who actually liked the movie, also didn't get it, and were just listing the reasons why it's possible etc.   
As for the second paragraph, it creates potential plot holes as well. Liz and Sue clearly have different memories (starting from the moment that Sue was created). If so, how did the old doctor know about Liz since it was his younger version that gave her the substance?   
But this could be explained - The old doctor was just stalking people who went there, once he noticed a new number in the locker pop up. The thing is, with how much the movie likes to explain literally everything (once again, reminding the viewer about substance usage, literally everytime Liz/Sue mess it up) I honestly think the writer just didn't this through lol

the hidden room part might have been comedic, i guess the joke didnt work for me but youd be surprised how lots of people who actually liked the movie, also didnt get it, and were just listing the reasons why its possible etc 
as for the second paragraph, it creates potential plot holes as well liz and sue clearly have different memories starting from the moment that sue was created if so, how did the old doctor know about liz since it was his younger version that gave her the substance 
but this could be explained  the old doctor was just stalking people who went there, once he noticed a new number in the locker pop up the thing is, with how much the movie likes to explain literally everything once again, reminding the viewer about substance usage, literally everytime lizsue mess it up i honestly think the writer just didnt this through lol

To your question, it’s a very easy-ish/linear plot to follow even if you self-censor the bonkers bits, but this movie WANTS to make you cringe.

More than a straight horror, thriller or even creature feature Substance is aiming and FULLY hits the BODY horror spooky-ookies bullseye.

TL:DR- like a legit rollercoaster you can close your eyes and enjoy the ride but just like any good rollercoaster if you open your eyes at the scariest bits  you’ll be treated to incredible madness that will make surviving the experience all the more fun and exciting in retrospect.",14,2024-10-24 15:47:41,"

If you think you have a tolerance level where that would work, you could watch it at home later. I think it depends on your level, re: gore. The film gives you pretty fair warning when something grotesque is coming, for the most part (there were a few specifically harrowing scenes where you knew what was coming and I just covered my face for like... a full minute. Because NOPE). THAT said: the sound design is, uh, very good so if it's not just visual for you, yeah skip. 

For me, I'm glad I saw it because I really liked the story/writing/themes and performances. There's SO much rich material in it and things to talk about.

Whenever I see him or Voight in a movie now, my first instinct is to think what’s the general reason for it. They both are open with their conservative beliefs and they were in a political movie this year, all the while this movie does come across as progressive and feminist. And AFAIK from brief reading, Quaid is the only one from the cast that’s really been outspoken about politics here… so… why him? Since he is controversial, and while I can see the point where it does seem he may be playing a bad person, I do still question it.

If it’s because he’s a good actor, it still feels odd because it can contradict the movies themes in a way. If it’s because they want to get interest in conservatives watching the movie and maybe present them with progressive ideas I can also see that. Although, I’m hoping this won’t be another movie that doesn’t really have a stance. I’ve seen a lot of hostility from certain groups being hateful to Erin Moriarty, so it really does make me wonder what exactly is trying to be said, or if there’s any kind of ulterior message or reinforcement going on.

Me dio mucho placer ese ""dialogo"" silencioso y visual.

Me reencantó con experimentar algo colectivamente en una sala de cine, creo que nunca lo había vivido. El silencio dentro del espacio los últimos 20 minutos se podía cortar con un cuchillo, no se oía ni una respiración, es como que todos estábamos en la misma sensación culiá desagradable pero atrapante.

Pero bueno, desde el inicio de la historia se tomaron bastantes libertades e incoherencias para terminar de contar la historia así que ya se veía que no iba a ser algo serio.

Finalmente, en lo que debo felicitar al director es en el hecho de que en toda la peli por más escenas sensuales y desnudos no sentí excitación en ningún momento xD estaba tan asqueado por la sobre saturación de los sonidos de tripas y las escenas de sangre y vísceras que solo podía sentir asco y pena por la mujer y su descenso a la locura.

But well, since the beginning of the story, many freedoms and inconsistencies were taken to finish telling the story so it was already seen that it was not going to be something serious

Finally, in what I must congratulate the director is in the fact that in all the movie for more sensual and naked scenes I felt excitement at any time XD was so disgusted by the overalviscera that could only feel disgusted and sorrow for women and their descent to madness

¿Por qué no les gustó el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,2024-10-22 20:24:55,"Yo creo que es molesto por el mismo hecho de que la sustancia va más allá del terror, es una pelicula muy humana y con un mensaje muy lindo, muchas personas se pueden identificar con la pelicula y con el dolor de las protagonistas.
La trama te hace sentir que llegara a algo, que habrá un quiebre, que en algun momento, el acto que sigue tendrá una conclusion. Pero al final , tiran esa construcción a la basura, y francamente es un poco decepcionante.
 En lo personal, me gustó mucho la pelicula, por lo mismo que ya dije, debo decir que siento rechazo por el genero del terror,  porque normalmente suelen prescindir de hacer buenos personajes o tener una profundidad, más allá de que de miedo, asco o simplemente sea bizarro. Esta pelicula fue más que eso y siento que es un avance para el genero del terror, pero el final no me convence, preferiria algo mas cliche y lindo, pero igual es bueno que los directores tomen desiciones así, e incursionen formas no tan comunes de hacer las cosas.",1,2024-10-22 17:39:47,"I think it is upset by the same fact that the substance goes beyond terror, it is a very human movie and with a very nice message, many people can identify with the movie and with the pain of the protagonists
The plot makes you feel that it will reach something, that there will be a break, that at some point, the act that follows will have a conclusion but in the end, they throw that construction in the trash, and it is frankly a bit disappointing
Personally, I really liked the movie, for the same thing I already said, I must say that I feel rejection for the genre of terror, because they usually do without making good characters or having a depth, beyond that of fear, disgusting orIt is simply bizarre this movie was more than that and I feel that it is an advance for the genre of terror, but the end does not convince me, I would prefer something more click and cute, but it is the same that the directors take decisions like that, and enter forms notso common to do things"

(At least in the US).


Also, along with the thread on beauty and Hollywood, I distinctly saw the loss of her youth at having given Sue life as a parallel to cultural beauty standards overall. A woman at 60 may despise how she looks in comparison to the younger beauties on the screen and in print, but the more time spent making the comparison, the more time and beauty are lost.

Sue is this better, happier, sexier version of Elisabeth while she’s on this “drug”. Everything is a breeze, everyone loves her and she loves herself. While Elisabeth initially agrees to respect the rules, this better version of herself is constantly pushing the boundaries because, at least at first, Sue doesn’t see the consequences for Elisabeth, the ‘sober’ version of herself. It isn’t until she wakes up as Elisabeth again that she realizes what she’s actually done to herself, and she can not wait until the week is up to do it again. When it’s time to switch from Sue to Elisabeth the next time, she pushes it. “What’s the worst that could happen?” “I’m sure it’ll be fine”. Now Elisabeth has to face the even scarier consequences of her actions, and she’s pissed. She’s started to separate ‘sober’ and ‘high’ her, and they resent each other. Sue hates Elisabeth for her lazy, slobbish, sad behavior. It’s everything she hates about herself. Elisabeth hates Sue because she’s actively sucking her life away, yet is the only joy she can feel anymore. But she still can’t stop.

I had a blast, I personally felt like it was a very dark comedy that obviously uses excessiveness and absurdity to its benefit to supplement the social commentary. This was the most fun I had in a theater all year, actually was nearly in tears laughing, but don't mistake that for a critique of this film - it's an appraisal. It had to be intentional, all the little things like suddenly introducing out of nowhere subtitles while the monster is speaking at the end - the totally over the top name for the creature in the third title card - and the fact that many characters are just straight up caricatures. It screamed to me dark comedy, but I don't think a lot of people will experience it that way. 

The biggest thing I could do without was the constant cutting back to things to bash you over the head with ""Hey, remember this? This is important!"" That came off as a bit corny to me and it happened several times, I think it would've benefited slightly more by respecting the audience and expecting them to remember obvious threads.

However, my favorite scene of her acting was when she was aggressively rubbing the make up off and messing up her hair. It's such a real, raw scene. No special effects or prosthetics, just pure acting of a woman who feels worthless of what society tells her just because she 60 years old. Margaret Qualley is also equally impressive in this. The scene where Sue was revive had the audience in my theater gasping of “oh shit!”. I love the gory body scenes. I also especially love the dreamlike, surreal comedic campy thriller vibes the film has too. The editing, directing, prosthetics, and screenplay are so great. I get why it won screenplay at Cannes.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

- Dropping the title card in the middle of the instruction video is genius! 
- Coralie Fargeat's directing is exceptional. I couldn't look away even disgusting things are happening on the screen. 
- The first act is slow paced but once the split happens, the movie gets crazy.
- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me. The car crash with no injuries, the chase in the house (reminded me of Coralie's previous movie, Revenge), Sue having great strength, the monster putting on earrings, and the endless blood spray.

Genuine moments of sadness and empathy for Moore's character, wonderful storytelling. Was cracking up when she turned into the 'witch'.

Amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects! As plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie! Shout-out to Quaid as well!

Ending scene was nuts! Reminded me a little of the shock at the end of 'Ready or Not' (another fav of mine), which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of Kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding.

The technical elements are great too. They are pretty similar to Fargeat’s first film Revenge (2017), in terms of the way it is shot, edited, and scored.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"On one hand I couldn't help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death. Desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things don't go as planned etc etc. I remember the Facelift episode of American Horror Story and one of the episodes of Guillermo Del Toro's horror anthology having a similar bit.

But I think The Substance really killed it and made something that still felt totally unique.

The body horror was relentless and I love how they tease the feeling of dread and disgust with the constant closeups. For me one of the grossest parts was Sue getting greedy and draining Elizabeth for more and more fluid as the site got more and more infected. Then finally all that comes out is some bloody pus. I felt like I spent the entire second half of the movie with my hand over my face cringing.

It was great portraying self-hatred through literally two different versions of yourself in conflict and the inevitable climax of trying to destroy yourself. One thing I didn't like about that final fight scene was how absolutely fragile Elizabeth had become in an earlier scene, struggling to stand without breaking her knee. Now she's 100 times more decrepit and taking hits like a boxer and still standing up. I think she should have died a lot earlier to keep things from getting comical but then the vicious beating could have ensued long after to really drive home the point of psychotic self-hatred.

Seeing her reflection in the doorknob was a fantastic and sad moment. Bringing everything back to the beaten up hollywood star was a cool touch.

When the final monstro form crumbled to pieces and all that was left was her face poking out I ALMOST thought her whole normal body was going to emerge unscathed and then she'd get a banal call from the company saying the experience was complete. ""Thanks for choosing us!"" But I guess that would have been a bit too goofy for no reason.",37,2024-09-20 02:06:52,one hand couldnt help feel like premise beaten death desperate longing youth beauty new experimental procedure product thing dont go planned etc etc remember facelift episode american horror story one episode guillermo del toros horror anthology similar bit think really killed made something still felt totally unique body horror relentless love tease feeling dread disgust constant closeup one grossest part getting greedy draining elizabeth fluid site got infected finally come bloody pu felt like spent entire second half movie hand face cringing great portraying selfhatred literally two different version conflict inevitable climax trying destroy one thing didnt like final fight scene absolutely fragile elizabeth become earlier scene struggling stand without breaking knee shes time decrepit taking hit like boxer still standing think died lot earlier keep thing getting comical vicious beating could ensued long really drive home point psychotic selfhatred seeing reflection doorknob fantastic sad moment bringing everything back beaten hollywood star cool touch final monstro form crumbled piece left face poking almost thought whole normal body going emerge unscathed shed get banal call company saying experience complete thanks choosing u guess would bit goofy reason
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"This might be ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THIS YEAR. Holy shit, Quaid (lol ""Harvey"" I seen what you did there) stole the scene every time he was on camera, Qualley really was out to be *that* alpha bitch, Moore's self loathing doubt and her losing it after the first half of the film made me laugh ruefully for her.

The plot is makes it clear that Sue was going to sabotage Elizabeth (I thought Elisabeth was gonna get revenge given the chicken in the navel bit by way of overeating then causing her to sprout food from herself...?) but I loved it's unpredictability and descent into utter chaos at the end. The ostensible cliche phrase ""take care of yourself"" had so much weight to it, plus I love the commentary on how showbiz will chew one up and spit you out especially if you're eye candy (dear lord so many butt shots, I'm assuming commentary on the male gaze?), and also body dysmorphia and the lengths one would go for self preservation. Speaking of eye candy the chaotic cinematography is chef's kiss, I loved also when Harvey was around he would speak to the camera whether it be Sue or Elisabeth.

The end of the film with Monstro Elisasue gave me so many mixed feelings of dark humor laughter at how unhinged it was, sadness out of a fading star, and shock at the horrifying amalgamation of body parts. You couldn't help feel sorry for the Elisabeth slime's last chance at happiness as she slowly fades at her Hall of Fame star (that foreshadowing at the beginning with the burger)

The only negatives I have are nitpicks: One the slow pacing until the middle of the film, two (suspension of disbelief be damned) how in gods name did Sue become an interior designer overnight?

TL;DR The social commentary, the chaos and unpredictability, great acting, and utterly over the top presentation for the film, make it one of my favorite films of the year so far!

9/10, don't pull chicken from your navel and while I think there was social commentary to be said, Qualley's got a nice ass

My headcanon is that some legitimate medical corporation is developing this but beta-testing on the black market. 

Another take - the doctor who recommends it to her. How would he know when her refill time was? Pay even closer attention - the number on the line sounds like his Other Self. Do you think the doctor developed the substance and wants to inflict his suffering to others? He wasn’t exactly happy in the diner.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Had some time to digest this (and get to a computer rather than my phone).

I really appreciated this film for so many things (acting, practical effects, editing, score, etc.) but I really think there’s something special about the screenplay and that it really reflects a female POV that is missing from a lot of horror.

First, the real horror is so very internal. Elizabeth’s problem is not so much Hollywood or the way older women are tossed aside, though that’s certainly there, her real problem is the way she views and values herself. She is self destructive because the real problem is internal, it’s the way she views herself. She cannot see what we as viewers can see (and casting Demi Moore here was a stroke of genius) at any age, she is stunning by any societal standard—but that’s not how she sees herself. She sees herself as haggard and a monster, and when the “misuse of the substance” takes a toll on her, that’s the toll it takes. It makes her appear on the outside the way she feels and views herself on the inside. That scene before the date is heartbreaking if you’re a woman because we have all experienced that dysmorphia to some extent—that experience of being unable to really see yourself because of feelings of inadequacy. This really makes this film so different than most others—it’s not about being turning into a monster, it’s about seeing yourself as a monster.

The heartbreaking thing about Sue is that she's not a younger Elizabeth. She's someone else entirely. The best version of you (as a woman) isn't even YOU. It's someone else entirely. You were never good enough. And even the best version of you has insecurities because she's not good enough either.

Second, the narrative structure really emphasizes this. In a lot of screenplays, once Elizabeth unlocked Sue, Sue would have gone on to take down the man--- to get revenge on everyone in Hollywood who mistreated Elizabeth. But that’s not at all where the narrative goes. Because although there are many terrible characters, they really aren’t the antagonist. Elizabeth is both protagonist and antagonist. She is truly her own worst enemy, both in her Sue form but also in her Elizabeth form as she punishes herself by binging and trashing her apartment and destroying everything around herself. This could have very easily strayed into a revenge tale, and I think it’s partially the female POV that sidesteps that narrative to take the story in a different direction. 

Third, I love how the male gaze is used in this film. I think it’s very brave and effective. It’s not shown to be bad. It’s just cranked up to 11, and then 15, and then 200 until you are disgusted by it without being told to feel that way. All the huge close ups of bodies and body parts. Especially at the end, where Monstro Elisasue is just an amalgamation of body parts. It’s so in your face and unabashed. The end is seriously like “You like tits? You want tits? Here’s another one for ya!” It makes things so sexual that they become completely UN sexual. And all the nudity is presented in the most clinical of settings—against a white tiled bathroom. I’ve seen people say that they feel like the film falls into presenting the male gaze and I think that’s missing the point—it’s about letting the audience reject the male gaze in a way Elizabeth never really is able to. It’s wildly effective.

I see why this won a screenplay award at Cannes. It’s not only audacious and original but it has a POV that is largely absent from the genre and really deserves to be represented.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. I went in completely blind (well ok I read about one sentence that said Demi Moore is in it and she takes some drug to be younger and I knew it was a horror film) and only learned about the movie a few days ago.

I was already fully onboard with just the out there sci-fi type premise of birthing a younger self and trading consciousness weekly. That alone can make an interesting movie. Then it goes more and more body horror and it’s just…wow. I loved the over the top absurdity of…I guess the entire movie. But especially the dance scene, Sue just walking around on the street, and even her drinking a Diet Coke. 

And of course, the absolutely bonkers completely insane ending. I’m usually pretty good at guessing the ending especially of horror films having watched so many but I did not see this coming. Not like that. You know something is gonna go wrong but wow.

Demi Moore was stellar. Her best performance? And I didn’t know Dennis Quaid could chew scenery so good. About as good as he chewed them shrimps. 

Like another commenter said, my theater didn’t get up when the lights kicked on. Everyone just kinda sat there in silence for a bit. I hope this film picks up steam because it might be the best theater experience I’ve had with a horror movie or almost any movie in some time. It will be a shame if it doesn’t get the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Though I dunno who I would recommend this to. I feel like the average person would think I’m at best a sex pest by the middle or complete lunatic by the end. 

Question - did they share the same brain/memories at all? I thought not but it makes you think - kinda a raw deal if you don’t get to experience it at all. I suppose that’s the point, the aging movie star watching as a younger version supplants her. But if you don’t get the memories or ability to live through your younger self directly I don’t think many would take the substance. I know they must share something somehow due to the chicken dream though. 

Also I was CACKLING during the climax. And the over the top dance. I think it made a lot of people in my theater uncomfortable (both scenes really) and I and my wife had to be the only people openly laughing out loud. The cut to the child previously so excited sobbing and covered in blood made me laugh even more.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it. 


The first 60 minutes are a fantastic drama/scifi adjacent take on womanhood; that alone was gripping. But there were cracks in the glamour. You could feel how defeated Elisabeth was. Demi acted her fucking ass off. 


Then the next 40 minutes manages to tell a gripping story of a woman who so desperately yearns for youth that she creates an entirely new person. Not a younger version of herself mind you, just a completely new person. A *better* person. Sue begins to ascend and realizes how “sad” Elisabeth is and grows disgusted of her, turning her into nothing more than cattle for her to take youth from. 


That alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just Hollywood. Also shout out to Coralie for having a real reason for showing off Sues body; it’s over the top for a reason and doesn’t feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror - it has purpose and meaning. 



Then you have the last 30 minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie I’ve ever seen. This is Society meets The Thing meets The Fly wrapped in a Barbie bow. The monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out Elisabeth head taped on. It’s just so ridiculous and absurd and it *works*. I’m sure there’s so many metaphors I’m missing, but I did think that the end where she’s literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period. Maybe that’s off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me. 



This movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, Demi Moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of American culture around women in general. 



I have no notes, nothing needed to be changed. 10/10.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I've just come back from watching it and I absolutely fucking loved it. I'm a huge fan of body horror films, and special effects guys like Brian Yuzna. This does not hold back.

The first two acts are relatively sedate and take a while to get going but the sound design is phenomenal. Every act gets a sound which is amped up. Inserting a needle gets a squelch. Eating a shrimp gets a crunchy squelch. Even down to the shoes that Quaid character has have these steel heels so he just stomps down the hallway.

The third act is what's going to have everyone talking though. That's where the training wheels are fully off and it goes absolutely crazy. At one point it looks like everyone is at a GWAR concert with the spraying of blood into the audience.

There is commentary there about how women in this industry are highlighted, used and then spat out but I liked how it didn't preach about it, you could argue its almost quite reserved about it in truth. Small parts like the first time Sue walks down the street people step to the side for her to when Elizabeth does a day later and people are virtually bumping into her.

Demi Moore is phenomenal in this. I don't know if a body double was used at times and I don't think brave is the right word as it sounds almost patronising but she shows a lot. To have a camera pointed at you to show where you've aged and how things get lumpy and bumpy especially when you were known to be absolutely beautiful must have been hard for anyone to do. I wonder if the fact that it was a female director that Moore took this part on. The film works on another level too because the focal point is Moore, and her history of surgery and chasing youth.

I'm so glad to have seen this on a big screen. The only downside was how few people were there. I've read online of people being in packed cinemas where people were dry retching.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I have a hot take. The film wants us to feel heartbroken for Elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she can't help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change. The implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards. Judging by people's comments here (""no, honey, you're so beautiful!""), it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way. This troubles me. I think it's really the wrong message from this film. Elizabeth's core mental illness from the start was not her self-loathing; it was her self-obsession. Everything about her life was completely and utterly self-absorbed. (She makes Donald Trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison.) Trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful (or great) they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin. The thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasn't, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful; it was her need for human connection. And no amount of feeling beautiful and self-love would have lead her (and in fact did not lead her) to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be self-absorbed. The deeper moral that this film missed is: Being self-obsessed is unhealthy—a meaningful life comes from caring about others.",16,2024-09-19 13:24:29,hot take film want u feel heartbroken elizabeth despite absolutely beautiful body cant help seeing ugly end putting hell trying change implied moral learn love body regardless beauty standard judging people comment honey youre beautiful seems film succeeded interpreted way trouble think really wrong message film elizabeth core mental illness start selfloathing selfobsession everything life completely utterly selfabsorbed make donald trump look like empathic caring person comparison trying help someone like telling beautiful great like trying help heroin addict giving heroin thing fueled endless existential drive external validation wasnt ultimately need feel beautiful need human connection amount feeling beautiful selflove would lead fact lead make meaningful connection long continued selfabsorbed deeper moral film missed selfobsessed unhealthya meaningful life come caring others

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"First the body horror and sound design was 10/10 for me, def one of the best experiences I’ve had seeing this film in theaters.

But my main gripe is that I don’t understand Elisabeth’s motivations AT ALL. Why did she go through this process when the end result has no benefits for her?

We establish that Elisabeth aligns her self worth with her looks so the logical through-line is that she’s willing to do anything to feel beautiful again, but the substance only makes a younger and better looking clone of her. Elisabeth does not experience anything Sue does, she’s basically in a coma whenever she trades places. So what’s the point?

I could maybe see that she would want to live vicariously through Sue like a parent might do, but Elisabeth resents Sue from the beginning and her presence only makes her feel worse about herself. 

Then I thought maybe she’s willing to do this since she needs money and can’t sustain her way of life since she’s too “old and unattractive” to do her previous job, but the film never makes a note that she’s struggling and even if she was fired from her job I assume she’s made enough over the years to live comfortably. 

Also, why was Elisabeth so distraught when Sue didn’t respect the balance and made Elisabeth age more by not switching in time? Elisabeth didn’t have friends or hobbies and when she was in control she stayed in the house all day. If she was already unhappy with the way she looked, then I’m not sure why becoming uglier would affect her so much.  

I’ve seen this type of idea put on screen before where a woman does something drastic to regain/attain beauty but then it goes wrong and the end result is that she’s worse off than where she started. If the point of this film was just to make a gory film spectacle like Terrifier that’s not meant to be analyzed or hard to think about, then at least make it shorter (the run time was kinda long). It would’ve had the same result and shock value imo. 

Someone please tell me if I’m missing something? I personally think character motivations such as this can’t really be swept under the rug since it’s the catalyst for literally everything that happens in the movie.

Tldr; Elisabeth’s motivations for taking the substance were unclear to me since none of the results seemed to benefit her in any meaningful way.",10,2024-09-19 13:24:29,first body horror sound design def one best experience ive seeing film theater main gripe dont understand elisabeths motivation go process end result benefit establish elisabeth aligns self worth look logical throughline shes willing anything feel beautiful make younger better looking clone elisabeth experience anything shes basically coma whenever trade place whats point could maybe see would want live vicariously like parent might elisabeth resents beginning presence make feel worse thought maybe shes willing since need money cant sustain way life since shes old unattractive previous job film never make note shes struggling even fired job assume shes made enough year live comfortably also elisabeth distraught didnt respect balance made elisabeth age switching time elisabeth didnt friend hobby control stayed house day already unhappy way looked im sure becoming uglier would affect much ive seen type idea put screen woman something drastic regainattain beauty go wrong end result shes worse started point film make gory film spectacle like terrifier thats meant analyzed hard think least make shorter run time kinda long wouldve result shock value imo someone please tell im missing something personally think character motivation cant really swept rug since catalyst literally everything happens movie tldr elisabeths motivation taking unclear since none result seemed benefit meaningful way

Because if it's more of a cloning scenario I find it hard to believe Elisabeth would be counting the days to be Sue again since for her it would essentially just be a week-long nap, but again...how did the fight work?

There’s the clear theme of the pressure women feel in our patriarchal society. There’s also just a thread that highlights the inner monologue of an insecure person, and the brutality and self-sabotage we all inflict upon ourselves. We’re our own worst enemy, right?

But the most poignant theme for me is the commentary on addiction. I’ve had struggles with that before, and to me, this was actually the main theme of the movie. The phone pinging with messages like “are you ok?” while Elizabeth sits in darkness was too real. Or when she’s laying in the shower, banging her head on the floor saying “stop, stop….” I bet a lot of people know exactly what that feeling is like. I know I do. Glad I’m not there anymore. 

The whole concept of someone recklessly stealing time and physical health from themself is all about addiction to me. The self-hatred, the isolation, and the diminishing returns all ring true. The idea of slowly killing yourself while pretending everything is fine is something most addicts can resonate with.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This is being highlighted as a friction point for a lot of people in a number of reviews, but for me it worked on a sort of subliminal/intuitive level. In terms of what is shown in the movie, we clearly see a transference of perspective when Sue is ""born"" and the whole 2001 sequence occurs smashing into her first person POV. I took this as Elisabeth's consciousness being transported literally into Sue, so the same consciousness is operating for each week period in whatever body has been animated. I think the movie makes it unclear because we see Elisabeth and Sue both call the Substance company to complain about ""her"" actions, but I think this reflects the way that Elisabeth/Sue are unable to see the alternative body as belonging to them for various reasons that I can't fully articulate. Elisabeth cannot overcome her resentment even though she **is** Sue, and Sue doesn't seem able to see herself as Elisabeth; she steals the stabilizing fluid even though it's damaging the version of herself that...I guess she'll become? (It's **definitely** unclear what would happen if this situation didn't implode within the few months the movie spans IIRC; would Sue age into Elisabeth? Would she age at all? Does she only break down because they mutually abuse the system, or would she always have had a limited shelf life?)",8,2024-09-19 13:24:29,highlighted friction point lot people number review worked sort subliminalintuitive level term shown movie clearly see transference perspective born whole sequence occurs smashing first person pov took elisabeths consciousness transported literally consciousness operating week period whatever body animated think movie make unclear see elisabeth call company complain action think reflects way elisabethsue unable see alternative body belonging various reason cant fully articulate elisabeth overcome resentment even though doesnt seem able see elisabeth steal stabilizing fluid even though damaging version thati guess shell become definitely unclear would happen situation didnt implode within month movie span iirc would age elisabeth would age break mutually abuse system would always limited shelf life

One of the greatest cinema experiences I've had in a loooooong time, maybe ever, and I'm always at the movies, very up to speed with what's out and what's going on in film and horror in general. Felt like I was watching something I'd never seen before. Amazing. Going back on Thursday to watch for a second time as it hits wide release on the 19th.

Definitely a film that you need to see in a cinema. It could be watched, and enjoyed, at home, but it's certainly the kind of film that is really elevated by the cinema experience. Easily going to be one of the most talked about and biggest movies of the year, and already an instant cult (or maybe not) classic.

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Saw last night, woke up this morning thinking about it.

This is how I can tell that the symbols are functioning as such. I suppose that’s my most basic test for whether a movie is any good.

This is why I watch horror movies. It seems the usual method of making video entertainment is to throw in some symbols, hope something sticks… And it seems that horror alone follows symbols to see where they lead, and then the filmmaker reports their discoveries honestly.

Just a few examples from the movie: the glass box in which Elizabeth lives overlooking the city, the entire bathroom lol, the hallway to the bathroom, which is inexplicably spiral inside the other otherwise cubic apartment, the hallway at the TV studio, the camera lens, the colors… god that pink is oppressive!

I was so suspicious that the movie came from an intellectual/social commentary perspective. The kind of movie that would have been better as an essay. But no, this is the real deal. A dream that shakes you and stays with you.

It’s a real exercise in empathy to watch this as a man. I feel like I learned something about my species in my time and place.

Anyway, it’s a very good movie. I feel the same drive to watch it again, unpack it, look under the hood to see how it works… The same way I used to with the Coen Brothers in their heyday (Barton Fink through Inside Llewyn Davis)

It’s very clever, very well-made, very true. 

Oh yes, and very funny. Though I was the only person in the movie theater laughing, which was surreal.

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Just saw it tonight and can’t stop thinking about it either. I avoid body gore at all costs so I put this one off and went in hesitantly, my hand halfway over my eyes. But by the first body gore scene I was entranced and couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. But the message, symbolism and overarching theme of this movie had me so hooked that I wasn’t bothered by the body gore. I felt empathy for her character as she sunk further into chasing her younger self + perfect face & body. She kept going, knowing there would be consequences, but she didn’t want to give it up. Body/beauty perfection can be addictive and often we don’t see the damage we do to ourselves until after it’s done. Extreme dieting, ED, cosmetic surgery, procedures, etc. taken to extreme lengths to achieve perfection, body dysmorphia, we end up hurting ourselves in the long run.) 
*recovering from an ED so a lot of this movie resonated with me*
Being accepting and happy with how we look as we age can be difficult, especially in a world of such demanding perfection for women to remain youthful and perky, while men age, look older, without being criticized or objectified. 
It’s polarizing and this movie did an amazing job at showing what a nightmare being objectified and chasing perfection can feel like. “Pretty girls should always smile.” Raise your hand if you cringe when men say that, and how young were you when a man first said it to you. I can’t wait to watch it again.

The way the rapid cell division took place was actually demonstrated quite well in my opinion and knowing the budget made it all the more better, the scientific aspect of the body horror made it all the more terrifying.

The desperation that sets in to become the best possible example of human genetics is ironic given the fact that you literally are manufacturing it rather than trying to embrace it

First, the men. All men (extras excluded) in the film are portrayed as either greddy assholes or complete simps, no in-between. Not that I was offended, of course. It just seemed that the message could be a little more subtle, more nuanced. But it kept beating over the audience head with the message ""all men in the entertainment industry wants to use womens bodies for their evil intent mwhahaha"" Dennis Quaid is awesome in the role.

Parts of the plot were a little forced. You mean to tell me a Oscar winning wealthy famous celebrity would go, by herself, all alone, into that little dingy door? Fuck that. Could be an organ harvesting room, or for kidnapping, she doesn't know!! But noooo, she proceeds without a flicker of a doubt, because plot. Then, as Sue, she suddenly becomes a world class engineer who is capable of building a functional door in her bathroom, all by herself? Okay sure.

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"Fucking loved it. It feels like a classic. There's something about how prescient yet universal the themes are, how perfectly the sci-fi examines those themes, how perfectly the cast is, and how effective it is both on an emotional, thematic level, but also as a gonzo, over the top, gleefully distasteful B movie. It feels like a new pillar of body horror that we'll talk about in the same context as The Thing and The Fly.

It's also the rare horror movie that swings bigger and bigger all the way to the end. It really goes for it, and whether or not you think it's fully successful, you can't deny the ambition and execution and the sheer spectacle of it.

Also, as many have already pointed out, the shrimp scene made me actually look away.

I think the concept of a “you are one” is very interesting and I think can lead to misconceptions about what is going on. I think Sue is more of a child of Elizabeth than a conscious sharing being but Elizabeth allows and wants Sue to continue in the way a parent may continue to support a child as much as they lose their own life and individualism (eg a parent drops their kid off for soccer practice).

I attended a scream unseen screening the other week, and was overjoyed that it was The Substance, a film I've been excited about since I saw a brief teaser trailer, and as a big fan of Revenge, I was very excited, although after Long Legs failed to deliver, I was wary of letting myself get too hyped for another horror film this year, and expectations were tempered going in.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

Just finish seeing it a half hour ago in the theater.  My my initial thoughts: 

Holy god. 
One of the years best, easily. But holy god.

- so many Kubrick references and homages, as well as DePalma and Lynch. And Cronenberg . Both Senior and junior. Even a little Billy Wilder.

- I hope Demi Moore gets recognized for an absolutely fearless performance.

- Best make up and special effects - much of it had to have been practical - I've seen this year.

- holy god

- what is it with French directors and surreal, absurdist body horror? Feels very much in the spirit of Titane.

- the last 30 minutes are fucking wild.",1,2024-09-22 21:41:32,finish seeing half hour ago theater initial thought holy god one year best easily holy god many kubrick reference homage well depalma lynch cronenberg senior junior even little billy wilder hope get recognized absolutely fearless performance best make special effect much practical ive seen year holy god french director surreal absurdist body horror feel much spirit titane last minute fucking wild

Also haven’t heard an audience that buzzed or chattering opinions that much for some time after, too. Only one walkout from what I saw: just as Sue’s first show was being shot. 

I think the term Cronenbergian is used a bit too much in regards to body horror, but the satirical style of this really reminded me of the likes of Crash and Videodrome, particularly in regards to the growing prosthetics and makeup. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were both great, although Dennis Quaid stole the show in his scenes. 

There’s a real conflict of the horror and humour at times - the cooking/ chat show scene walks the thin line between the two perfectly. And there’s a good deal of fear factor and tension aside from the body horror elements. Certainly a lot to unpack here, and I look forward to doing so.",18,2024-09-09 21:05:08,long time since ive screening many people silent quite time half full bath could tell everyone captivated story almost start finish also havent heard audience buzzed chattering opinion much time one walkout saw sue first show shot think term cronenbergian used bit much regard body horror satirical style really reminded like crash videodrome particularly regard growing prosthetics makeup great although stole show scene there real conflict horror humour time cooking chat show scene walk thin line two perfectly there good deal fear factor tension aside body horror element certainly lot unpack look forward

The long scene renovating the bathroom to hide the body was unnecessary, just drag it into a closet and we’re good. Two hours and 20 minutes—just not necessary— and so many unbelievable moments besides the ones that were supposed to be unbelievable. You can’t show up for a performance on New Year’s Eve at a major without a rehearsal and just find a way on stage. When the older version of her could barely move and then suddenly could run and fight?

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Fargeat has her cake and eviscerates it too

She has something to say about beauty standards, about overt sexualisation and how the strive for perfection is so ingrained that women will often be their own worst critics - the scene where Elisabeth is preparing for her date but no matter what she’ll never be as “perfect” as Sue is uncomfortably realistic - while at the same time showing the power and addiction of beauty and why it’s allowed to be a part of our culture.

And she tells that message in the most gonzo, blood-drenched, in-your-face, WTF way possible to make it stick. Holy shit that is the most batshit final act of the year.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Needed somewhere to discuss so hope it’s okay to jump in 😅 as a woman that is closer to 40 than 30, there was a lot of the societal commentary that hit very close to home. The impossible beauty standards that become internalised, the male gaze and misogyny, fear of ageing and the loss of identity when losing your career due to nothing other than being seen as too old, lack of self-confidence in your value beyond how you look, the consequences brought to your later self by selfish choices and not caring for the impact or for your future wellbeing, the fear of abandonment and desperate need to be loved … and that’s just what hit a personal note, let alone the rest!

(And one element I’ve not seen discussed yet is that of the role of Elizabeth as the “mother”, and very much like the pushy beauty pageant moms that make their kids live out what they never could or to relive their glory days through them.) 

I was told by my partner this was a “body horror comedy”, and I went in without knowing anything else about it. I am not a fan of horror, and wouldn’t choose to watch anything that makes me too squeamish. My fingers were over my eyes several times 🙈 I said to my partner, “if this is a comedy just like Barbarian was a thriller, you’re in trouble” 😂 I’ve gotta say as disturbed as I was by it in many parts, it is incredibly thought provoking. As the credits rolled, the full screen of people just sat there talking about what madness they’d just witnessed for a good while!

Next weekend, there's about 6 films vying for my attention.

Anyway, I hadn't read up anything about the film so had just seen the trailer, but to say it was weird is an understatement. It was like a Cronenberg film, but without the name, albeit quite a slow start that I'd mostly skip over if I was going to watch it again. I'm toying between 8.5-9/10.

Plus, the same female director made 2018's brilliant Revenge, which hand plenty of gore, and is basically the ‘Kill Bill’ that Tarantino should have made, as I thought those two films were lacking overall.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"A great experience but I don't think it's a film that I'm likely to revisit. It was enjoyable but didn't have as much to say as I wanted it to.

As many have said, The Substance isn't concerned with subtlety or nuance.  It's got one point to make, a sledgehammer and some inspired body horror.

There are obvious comparisons that can be made, but the one I'm stuck on is Under the Skin. I think they share a lot of the same DNA - bold, bonkers, divisive and heavily stylised. I love to rewatch Under the Skin though. It speaks to me in a way that The Substance didn't. 

I appreciated the satire but I don't know how successful it was. It's a film about the male gaze but it never subverts that - it's just very male gazey. It wants to satirise figures like Harvey Weinstein and Vince McMahon, but Harvey gets no comeuppance, instead he gets a lot of laughs. It wants to satirise society's insane reactions to women aging but turns Demi Moore into a monstrous hag who becomes insanely jealous of a younger woman's success and then dies horrifically.

I'm glad I saw it. I had fun with it. It ticked so many boxes for me (show me gross shit accompanied by noises that make you feel like you're losing your mind, I'm normally happy).

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"SPOILER ALERT
I'm not a guy who particularly cares about morals in media, but imo the message of the film conflicts somehow with how it is described in the reviews: in the narrative world the substance can be used indefinetly if applied as prescribed (""maintaining the balance""), a fact which avoids an honest reckoning with the ultimate futility of maintaining immortal beauty/control of bodily functions. so it boils down to the following: the failings of the users is an individual fault, and the elizabeth/sue monstrosity in the grand finale is an object of ridicule. - so I think the film somehow fails in this regard. with it's handling of topics of sexism, ageism in the industry, body shame, reproduction etc the movie is somehow clustered and all over the place, a lot of cool ideas and allegories half-exposed and discussed. - this out of the way: I think the movie is great at conveying the bodily horror technically, it's male gazing zooms on frantically swinging hips and oozing wounds. Moore's performance during the first half (when the tone of the movie strikes a better balance between the comic and the tragic) is superb - contrast it to the scene where she cooks and watches Sue in the tv, where the ""comedic"" and audience distance took way overhand imo. qualley's performance is great too, but I quickly got fed up with the shots on her - the technical critique of the male gaze gets repetetive quite fast imo. really enjoyed the sound.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I loved the movie. Yes it was way too long and the pacing wasn't perfect, but the atmosphere it creates is intense. The cinematography is also spot on. The two leading ladies carry the whole movie. Good use of prosthetics.

The most disturbing scenes are not the violent or body horror ones which are not even that intense, but the fear of ageing and the obsession we have for the passing of time, opportunities, fame/exposure and our past selves. The scenes where Demi looks in the mirror and then compares herself to Sue and constantly touches up her make up and her outfit are so heavy and everybody I think can relate, especially people past 25 who are starting to see the signs of ageing and the first changes in their appearance, men AND women.

The moments where she is hopeful and then everything turns for the worst well represents the risks and foolish things people are willing to take and do to look young. And it can be anything: drugs, diet, digital filters, fillers, surgery, fake teeth, fashion choices...

I hoped the feminist elements wouldn't be as pronounced as I think this is, in different ways, a universal experience especially in our modern social media mediated times. But the meta element of an ageing celebrity played by someone who was recently scrutinized for her facial procedures and looks was also a boss move on Demi's part.

Another detail that I found disturbing was the lack of information provided with the substance: it really captures today's beauty market so well with tons of energy based and at home devices and products that are sold with little care and scientific studies and people use them with little guidance and knowledge... a growing phenomenon is severe facial fat loss induced by microcurrent, lasers and radiofrequency devices. This was captured flawlessly in how Elizabeth jumps on The Substance with little hesitation and little care for the whole process, even when things starts getting weird. And the meth addict symptoms were poignant as well.

As for the finale, I loved the camp ending, it helps balance the uneasiness of the central/later part of the movie but I guess there were a couple of other directions the movie could have gone and explored so even if it is not a masterful scene per se, it was able to surprise me. But it was a fun scene that clearly pays homage to a cult classic and gives a strong statement about how, at least in hollywood but in modern times in general, the ""audience"" is what feeds this narrative and this obsession for beauty and youth, so everybody is guilty in the end and the whole splatter thing is a release of all the nasty emotions embodied by the monster.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"This is if Cronenberg, Lynch and Verhoeven made a movie but more visually striking than Refn. This movie is the definition of unapologetic. I was not ready for how much everything escalated by the end, and the movie was not shy or subtle about the points it was making. I was blown away by the starking visual contrast between ""beauty"" and ""ugliness"" and yet the movie made them both gross and sexual at the same time to ultimately expose us, the viewers, for our unhealthy gaze.

The substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves. The paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless. This is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm. We wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder! It shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions. We are covered in our own blood. The walls are covered in blood.

Yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody. Every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character. We see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain.

Our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too. And she does not hold back. Yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd. The comedy in this movie is absolute gold. The villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious. The absurdity of this movie is so refreshing.

In terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate. It is never stagnant, but it's also not in a rush. After all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage.

This is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped. My only note would be I wish they didn't do the hamfisted voice overs at the end. I know most viewers would have missed that point. But I don't think it would have taken away from the movie. Maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as Easter eggs for the second watch. Really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience. 9.8/10.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Just saw it today, and wow, I thought it was brilliant, though some in my audience seemed to think it was over the top, especially by the end. To me, I've never seen a movie quite like this, and mad props to Fargeat for executing something so personal with such a high level of artistry and confidence and Moore and Qualley for allowing themselves to be so emotionally and physically vulnerable to put this on screen. For as darkly funny as much of this movie is, it's really got a big emotional heft, and Moore carries a lot of that with her performance and walks the balance of the emotional part and the absurdist black comedy so well. It can be a tough watch, not just because of the gore really, but honestly because Moore's character almost feels like she's at war with herself. Her character's self-hatred and self-abnegation is just crushing to watch on screen. In a lot of ways, the movie feels so much like a psychological horror movie as well before it goes full on body horror extravaganza in the final act. I really think that is because we are so pulled into the interiority of Elizabeth/Sue, to the point that the movie even switches to their first person perspective in several instances. 

I personally loved the ending; for me, it was like pulling the release on a valve and just releasing the pressure on all these heavy emotions and ideas building throughout the movie and almost was like a relief. Oddly enough, I actually found the ending to be the least nauseating; it was just so outlandish that it just kinda became hysterical and full-on satire at that point. The movie up to that point just has this heaviness and tension to it because you really do feel sorrowful for what Moore's character is experiencing; the final sequence just feels like one giant fuck you and condemnation to the whole hollywood culture around youth and beauty and like the ultimate way to ridicule it.

The first 2/3 of the movie definitely had my stomach churning at certain points (surprisingly the worst being watching Dennis Quaid eat shrimp). A lot of the food stuff in particular was just so nasty to me. I think people will be surprised about the moments in this movie that are emotionally disturbing and anxiety-inducing. Moore's scene in front of the mirror where she just kept going back actually made me so anxious because the self-doubt and emotional turmoil was so relatable, and you can feel the desperation and sadness she is going through. The body switch sequences were almost clinical and I felt like it just tapped into all these anxieties and fears around watching our bodies deteriorate and being poked and prodded by doctors as we get older. And Qualley's dance sequences were just so uncomfortable with the music and the camera movements. I was just really amazed how this movie almost felt like it was breathing through the screen with a lot of the textures and sounds. The sound, set design and makeup are just superb and just make this film such a sickening joy to watch. 

Maybe it's hyperbole, but to me it really feels like one of the most unique visions I've seen in a film in a long time. I really can't wait to watch it again, the first time is such an assault on the senses that it's definitely hard to process this film in one go.",1,2024-09-09 21:05:08,saw today wow thought brilliant though audience seemed think top especially end ive never seen movie quite like mad prop fargeat executing something personal high level artistry confidence allowing emotionally physically vulnerable put screen darkly funny much movie really got big emotional heft carry lot performance walk balance emotional part absurdist black comedy well tough watch gore really honestly moore character almost feel like shes war character selfhatred selfabnegation crushing watch screen lot way movie feel much like psychological horror movie well go full body horror extravaganza final act really think pulled interiority elizabethsue point movie even switch first person perspective several instance personally loved ending like pulling release valve releasing pressure heavy emotion idea building throughout movie almost like relief oddly enough actually found ending least nauseating outlandish kinda became hysterical fullon satire point movie point heaviness tension really feel sorrowful moore character experiencing final sequence feel like one giant fuck condemnation whole hollywood culture around youth beauty like ultimate way ridicule first movie definitely stomach churning certain point surprisingly worst watching eat shrimp lot food stuff particular nasty think people surprised moment movie emotionally disturbing anxietyinducing moore scene front mirror kept going back actually made anxious selfdoubt emotional turmoil relatable feel desperation sadness going body switch sequence almost clinical felt like tapped anxiety fear around watching body deteriorate poked prodded doctor get older qualleys dance sequence uncomfortable music camera movement really amazed movie almost felt like breathing screen lot texture sound sound set design makeup superb make film sickening joy watch maybe hyperbole really feel like one unique vision ive seen film long time really cant wait watch first time assault sens definitely hard process film one go

The Substance is a high-budget B-grade film purporting to critique Hollywood, sexism, aging ostracism, and the overall beauty industry. However, its execution feels reminiscent of a self-indulgent adolescent's misguided attempt at profundity.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"One or two moments of flashing and fast lights - largely just after The Substance itself is taken and the ‘other self’ is unveiled. Also as one of the central characters’ grows more famous there may be occasional moments of paparazzi-like camera flashes, although these are somewhat infrequent. The BBFC does have a photosensitivity warning on its website for the film though, which is usually a fairly good indicator.

Not sure if it’d have a similar effect, but there’s also some pretty rapid editing here and there. A car crash scene early on and also during scenes where a fitness/ workout show is being filmed (actually may also be some flashing lights as part of this). Third act in general also might have combinations of both due to some of the events and settings, where the combination of things might just make everything seem that bit more intense(?), but obviously no spoilers. 

Overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there. I think generally though, if you’ve seen the trailer in the cinema (which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts) that might give you a good indication of what some of the film’s sequences might be like?

Now look at the hot 20 something!"" which it plays straight for so long that by the time we get to the over the top final third, I was just waiting for it to be over and couldn't even bring myself to enjoy the batshit body horror I came for. Like we are supposed to think the characters pursuit of youth and beauty is foolish, even though in the weird make believe reality of the world life is over for a 50 year old Demi Moore, forced to hide away in her home and gorge herself on meat because she's past her prime. 

There was 0 characterisation beyond ""she's old and ugly therefore sad"" and ""she's young and hot therefore happy"". Which made me utterly unable to engage in her plight. Was surprised to find it was directed by a woman, because I could have sworn whoever responsible for that claptrap had never met a woman in their lives.

Shock value movies are good for this - stirring up conversation, getting a bunch of people online write ""OMG, you won't believe this"" posts, and maybe satisfying the core fan group who likes that sort of thing.

Cannes in general is kind of an odd place, with those reported 9 minute or so standing ovations for every movie. It's a circle jerk, this is part of it and it probably will be forgotten.

And honestly, I have no idea why movies like this, Titane or The House that Jack Built don't choose to debut at SXSW, or some other thematic festival...they could get more genre hype behind them and a well-timed release could then make them into decent/good box office hits.

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"Next year's Oscar race in the best actress category is at this point seemingly going to be Amy Adams vs Saoirse ronan and their movies on paper seem like they have a shot. I doubt this Cannes hype will last until awards season and Saoirse is kinda overdue. 

And actually, considering Emma Stone just got an Oscar for pretty much playing a sex obsessed prostitute, in explicit scenes, I think audiences/awards committees are interested or not against edgy material, but is anyone interested on awards level interested in a body horror that is another play at ""Hollywood likes only younger women?"" What is the message? Demi Moore who at 60 still looks better than most and who made her entire career on looking hot, because she never was much of an actress and she's a millionaire is questioning why she doesn't get cast anymore that much? I'm not really seeing how the business did her bad when she got 20 million I think, the then highest salary for any woman, for Striptease which was sold only on her nudity and hotness. So basically the reality is, if you're young and hot and not much of an actress, when you start getting older, Hollywood and showbiz moves on. I don't see this happening to people like Jodie Foster, Cate Blanchett, etc., maybe because they actually are good? Not sure how that's something evil. And even moreso, what men over 60 are treated by showbiz like hotness? I'm not seeing that too either, older men too have to kinda fight father time to stay in the loop.",-5,2024-05-19 23:06:39,next year oscar race best actress category point seemingly going amy adam v saoirse ronan movie paper seem like shot doubt cannes hype last award season saoirse kinda overdue actually considering emma stone got oscar pretty much playing sex obsessed prostitute explicit scene think audiencesawards committee interested edgy material anyone interested award level interested body horror another play hollywood like younger woman message still look better made entire career looking hot never much actress shes millionaire questioning doesnt get cast anymore much im really seeing business bad got million think highest salary woman striptease sold nudity hotness basically reality youre young hot much actress start getting older hollywood showbiz move dont see happening people like jodie foster cate blanchett etc maybe actually good sure thats something evil even moreso men treated showbiz like hotness im seeing either older men kinda fight father time stay loop

Get Out, Black Swan, The Sixth Sense, Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist, The Omen, Misery, Rosemary’s Baby, Carrie, The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth, Sweeney Todd and Jaws all were heavily nominated or even won big at the Oscars. 

But most of those tend to have pretty subdued performances as opposed to Malignant style acting. 

It’s easy to say the academy doesn’t like horror but horror has won best picture multiple times. I think it’s more that larger than life and borderline campy horror movies are more discriminated against. Pearl, Hereditary, The Babadook, Us, The Shining and Midsommar all deserved acting noms but all those movies had actors hamming it up and I think that’s the bigger thread connecting them than just the academy not liking horror.

I know it’s a satirical, humorous, and overt message about aging, beauty standards, and the male gaze but despite the campy tone at times I actually found this movie to be quite sad at its heart.

Demi Moore hasn’t been in many projects in years and is now in her early 60s. For her to do this indie left of center French horror film when she doesn’t have to—to be this aging character that had been put out to pasture—i just found her performance really courageous and vulnerable. 

The scenes with her alone as Elizabeth were heart breaking to me especially when she stands her date up because of her self hatred towards her appearance. And how she falls further into isolation and depression due to her compare/despair mentality and how invisible and ugly she perceives she is. I actually teared up at times because I saw myself in certain parts. Like how many times I’ve changed clothes before I date, looking in the mirror multiple times, eating junk when I’ve felt sad, etc.

The clear commentary on agism, the beauty standard, plastic surgery and the desperate clawing for youth was not lost on me. 

But what really made me sad in the activation stage was how Sue just left Elizabeth on the bathroom floor. Didn't close her eyes. Didn't try to move her to a more comfortable position. Didn't try to set up a cot or something for her. It was like the self hatred was palpable from the beginning. 

My only question was - they were one - but did they really remember each other's experiences? When the consciousness was being shifted back and forth between bodies, did Sue have the mindset of a 20 year old?

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I thought it was very good commentary on body dysmorphia and addiction. I thought the film was very expertly crafted and kind of realistic in terms of how the world looks when you are dealing with those things. The way that half of the movie takes place in her bathroom, the way she always managed to keep it hidden, always closing the door just in time before anyone else can see her switch, etc just hit really hard. I was half expecting a plot twist that her original body was never really altering and this whole time she was just imagining herself like that. I actually kind of liked the ending though, or at least I can’t think of a more powerful way they could have ended it— it would have been too easy if she killed Sue and lived the rest of her life as a hermit, or if she would have killed herself which I think ironically would have been too happy of an ending. The way I interpreted it was that she could have maintained a balance between Sue and Elisabeth and it would have all been okay, but she didn’t have the willpower to do so because of how powerful the addiction and shame spiral was— she no longer cared about protecting her body, she just wanted to stay high on Sue until it destroyed her body to the point of no return. Her new lifestyle was unsustainable, and because of that she now had to live with the consequences.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I absolutely love this movie. It’s comedic, disturbing, cheesy and over the top in all of the best ways, and yet so relatable at the same time with themes of self criticism and self love. I also picked up on references to substance abuse - I don’t think that’s where the movie title came from or anything of the sort, that’d be too direct and obvious. I’m in recovery myself so maybe it’s just the way my brain works lol but the way she’d have to RUN to the bathroom to extract more time from/for herself (sort of like a “fix”) and to keep from getting sick reminded me of that, especially when she did it in order to be able to perform. 

I’m typically not one for mixing comedy and horror but this one did it perfectly; certain moments that would usually make me laugh actually made me uncomfortable and I just sat there with my hand over my mouth like “what. the. fuck.” Some parts did make me laugh though which was clearly the intention. 

Demi’s performance in this is absolutely unreal. I don’t remember her being that good?? The cooking scene while she’s watching the interview is gorgeously disgusting, infuriating and hilarious. I forgot for a minute that I WASN’T watching Jessica Lange in AHS. I started to really feel for her as the movie progressed and she began to hate both (all?) versions of herself more and more. I think a lot of people can relate to the mirror makeup scene, followed by what I interpreted as a depressive episode with isolating, ditching plans, not taking care of yourself; in other scenes also the overeating, increasingly negative self talk, LOT of mental health and external/internal validation themes. When Elisabeth and Sue started treating each other like shit, saying really terrible things and literally fighting “each other” (fighting herself), I was like “well that’s not very good positive self talk.” And the bells went off when I realized it’s not far off from how I sometimes talk to myself. Gotta work on that.

Bravo to the filmmaker and the actors - they really put themselves out there. You're going to feel something by the end of the movie, which isn't something I can say about most horror films.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I know this post is older, but you said you wanted to discuss so here's my two cents from watching it tonight:

Fantastic cinematography and sound design hindered by a derivative plot. It felt like it was trying to do what black Swan did, except the themes of anorexia and ocd are replaced by themes of aging and, well, Hollywood. I really enjoyed the body horror segments but couldn't really get behind the pathos, especially considering how it felt like a more shallow version of Black Swan.

In my showing the film was preceeded by a trailer for A Different Man starring Adam Pearson, an actor with elefantitis. This kept playing in my mind during the final scene and what was supposed to portay a physical representation of the pain of Moore's character felt like a mockery. Perhaps this was a case of bad timing or perhaps it said something about us as an audience. I found this quite fascinating and it made me question my own prejudices in a way that was definitely not intended.

Ultimately,  I wanted to like it but I didn't. Visually, it did everything right, but the substance just wasn't there, no pun intended.",8,2024-09-10 10:18:59,know post older said wanted discus here two cent watching tonight fantastic cinematography sound design hindered derivative plot felt like trying black swan except theme anorexia ocd replaced theme aging well hollywood really enjoyed body horror segment couldnt really get behind pathos especially considering felt like shallow version black swan showing film preceeded trailer different man starring adam pearson actor elefantitis kept playing mind final scene supposed portay physical representation pain moore character felt like mockery perhaps case bad timing perhaps said something u audience found quite fascinating made question prejudice way definitely intended ultimately wanted like didnt visually everything right wasnt pun intended

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I honestly thought it was quite a poor film. Yes, I get the undertones of Hollywood - American culture in general - always wanting younger and prettier 'next big thing', but who doesn't know that? We all know that when a woman reaches a certain age, the establishment (across the board, not just Hollywood) ousts them and brings in someone younger (why do you think that news anchors all look like plastic-skinned androids?). We know this! This film isn't anything deep or meaningful, or saying something that hasn't been highlighted a million times before... Is that the selling point of this movie and what it is hinging on? And, of course in today's world, the males are the biggest, most disgusting and most evil caricatures of a real person. Do you not think that this narrative is getting old? Planting seeds in young peoples' minds that all men are 'evil' is not healthy and leads to a confused outlook on life, based on a half-truth and today's narrative. That is not a good thing.

Back to the culture: young woman feel the pressure of an impossible perfection - again mainly thanks to America  -  but is it not a tad self-obsessed and childish, as an adult, to still be hung up on 'being young'?
Plastic surgery is horrific in of itself - weird looking, moulded cat people - and if that is a theme, then it should have pointed in that direction. If anything, the underlying story should be about the evils of going under the knife and the mindset that brought a person to that point, with the protagonist realising that they are their own version of perfect, just as themselves. 

Now for the movie itself: the story was nonsense. It couldn't stick to its own narrative and if anything, Sue was an entirely different person from Liz, like they weren't at all connected. It didn't make sense. Then, Sue wanting to abuse then kill her old self - 'the Matrix' - surely knowing that if she does, she'll also die. Surely she knew that. It's stupid. Was it a commentary or a gross-out slapstick comedy? It was all over the place.

The third act. Jebus wept. Talk about being out-of-place. Where did that come from? The gore was more extreme than a b-movie classic, but again, stupid (how much blood does a person have?). Was the film wanting us to think about the 'themes' or be grossed-out? Sad or enjoying the gore? Look for meaning or switch-off?

Just my rant.",2,2024-09-10 10:18:59,honestly thought quite poor film yes get undertone hollywood american culture general always wanting younger prettier next big thing doesnt know know woman reach certain age establishment across board hollywood ousts brings someone younger think news anchor look like plasticskinned android know film isnt anything deep meaningful saying something hasnt highlighted million time selling point movie hinging course today world male biggest disgusting evil caricature real person think narrative getting old planting seed young people mind men evil healthy lead confused outlook life based halftruth today narrative good thing back culture young woman feel pressure impossible perfection mainly thanks america tad selfobsessed childish adult still hung young plastic surgery horrific weird looking moulded cat people theme pointed direction anything underlying story evil going knife mindset brought person point protagonist realising version perfect movie story nonsense couldnt stick narrative anything entirely different person liz like werent connected didnt make sense wanting abuse kill old self matrix surely knowing shell also die surely knew stupid commentary grossout slapstick comedy place third act jebus wept talk outofplace come gore extreme bmovie classic stupid much blood person film wanting u think theme grossedout sad enjoying gore look meaning switchoff rant

You're all beautiful in your own way. 
Beauty treatments are to enhance your self image, not change it to the point that now, you're another person. It can backfire with the psychological aspect, where one can end up hating their old self, become addicted to the newer, more youthful self. We all want to be loved and appreciated by others. 

Now for the women nowadays. This term feminism is not understood by majority of women today. Creepy men are hated by gentlemen and women. Anyway, feminism has made women egotistical. They think their beauty can run the show, but in fact it's the same fitness routine. She got the job, never changed her routine yet no one noticed and preferred the young woman except the one weird nerdy guy that always liked her the way she is. Apart from the one man,   the legacy of old Elizabeth disappeared in an instant. All spoken out of hatred, by her newer self, Sue. 
My warning to all, especially extreme feminists. Respect the gentlemen, don't put them down just because they're not model looking. Oh he's 6ft, that's perfect. Shorter, ignore him and let him suffer. Oh, he's not got a great face, ewww let him suffer. So, this mentality creates more evil men, joining the shareholders group and they'll profit from your beauty and you'll turn into puppets instead. Don't become a monsto and end up looking like a mess. Respect great men. Respect great women. We all have our flaws, don't focus too much and live your life. Elizabeth was never in a relationship, Sue was abusing her looks to get the natural tall, model men. For fun. Yet it's only those men unfortunately portrayed as only caring for sex. Not everyone revs the pedal and fuels their ego,  pictured as the male Sue of today. 

Men don't put make up or utilise certain beauty treatments. Nothing wrong with beauty treatments, it's a tool to enhance, not to change.  What we do as men, is accept our heights, good 6ft or not so good (judged by both Elizabeth and Sue's of the world), accept our male genetics despite all the negativity from women like Sue and Elizabeth. Both are one. Men are put down constantly. 
So this film in my perspective, is fuelling bad feminism and once again, not realising all the actual hard work us guys have to put up with. Financially lacking, no woman wants you. No height, women (even the short women apparantly deserve the height difference lol) hate you. No muscles, skinny,  again no woman wants you. But for men outside of the film industry, we all appreciate you, young or old. Its preferences and being open minded. If you find it ewww, don't tell them they're eww, it's soul destroying. 
Don't be that old man following Elizabeth, embrace your beauty. Beauty you can't change. We can lose weight, remove wrinkles under our eyes, put make-up on to enhance, apply creams to enhance your youthful skin and maintain them. But you can't change genetics. Height is the  one thing we can't change. Sue was called little or small, can't recollect. But the creepy seafood CEO called her small, despite her being the same height as him. Sue playing with her looks so the neighbour doesn't complain, again something weak men fall for. 

So, don't be Elizabeth and Sue, in personality. Also, don't be too crazy that you see yourself as unlovable. That goes for men as well. I just found out that the woman behind this fantastic film, is a feminist. This shows, and i need to address this as no one pointed this out and saw it in her viewpoint. No one wants to acknowledge the point of view of open minded men like myself who understand this, although i love seafood...

The aesthetics, the music, the metaphors, the actors and their acting, the originality, the complexity, the heaviness of the movie, the randomness and also the comedy.
I said it was funny how some people said it's puerile because watching the movie I thought about the men in the movie are puerile and kinda stupid.

This is a film about the female experience from youth to motherhood, ageism, and beyond. It’s about loving yourself and hating yourself. And the destruction that comes from the latter.

I’d also say it’s not an ‘all men are evil’ film, but it does point out the obvious inequalities that still exist for women in any walk of life that don’t for men. A systematic issue that still exists whether we like it or not and is proven widely (ahem gender pay gaps).

From medical neglect, impossible beauty standards, and misogyny.

The studio to me seemed to represent the film industry, with ""Harvey"" the boss being a direct reference to an abusive, male Hollywood executive. When Elisabeth goes to use the women's toilet, it's ""Out of Order"", so she's forced to use the men's.


I wondered if this was some kind of comment by Fargeat that, as a female ""horror"" director - especially an auteur - she can't avoid being compared to iconic male directors and can't avoid using the tools and tropes that they established. There simply aren't enough female auteurs - especially in horror - to draw from. In order to reach the spotlight, she's forced to walk a path laden with the work of older, male directors.


To me it felt like Fargeat was very deliberately referencing male horror auteurs in this film, partly to pay homage and partly, in a film about how the patriarchy dominates the entertainment industry, to say ""Look, I'm forced to use these tropes established by men, but I'm going to use them, and subvert them, to convey women's experiences of that world.

I think at the very least that you’re correct in identifying commentary on the industry. And that there’s a reason she has to use the men’s bathroom. The safest interpretation of that is simply that it highlights the industry’s lack of support for women and the emphasis on men. 

But I think there’s definitely something to what you’re saying about having to “act” to appeal to the male gaze. Not just physically the way Sue does but on the meta level, as well. The Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch references are almost the same thing as Sue lol. 

There’s definitely conversation to have there, whether it’s intentional or through the “death of the author” view that intentionality doesn’t matter.

If it helps, I had a theory that the city design in Transformers One had skyscrapers on the ground and on the ceiling because it created a mirror-like division in the city that visually embodied the division between Optimus and Megatron and thus the autobots and decepticons.

And when another cosmetic surgery (another transformation) is needed, the visual outcome may not be a desired one and there are only hints of the original person left, the rest is just a mess of flesh, out of proportion, out of place even.

When Sue was out for longer than 7 days it made Elisabeth older, but when Elisabeth binge ate and lazed around it didn’t impact Sue. I also feel they could have made some things a bit more subtle, sometimes it felt like they thought the audience is just stupid so they had to hammer points in but some subtlety could have made it so much better.

Even tho she created a copy it was an exact copy of her. I'm guessing someone that's willing to take a Substance just to relive their youth would be just as reckless as a younger form ot themselves or worse as it turned out. They were the same mind, just 2 separate bodies.

All she did was create a carbon copy of her selfish self but younger, better looking, and with a younger, more devil, may care attitude. When the New Year's opportunity came up, it was what she always dreamed, so she was gonna have it come hell or high water. It was her ultimate dream.

Instead of just accepting that we all get older and when our younger year's are behind it and our curtain comes closer to being drawn she got given an option. She didn't follow the rules and well the film shows u when someone with a narcissistic individual who displays sociopathic tendencies. Though ironically, she was not the best candidate.

You are correct tho a lot of people are holding this film in high regard and one of my first thoughts wen I saw the trailer was is this gonna be another case of style over substance (pun intended :)

Ahh so wot your saying is they keep hammering home the same theme 🤔 or message because and again I'm just assuming here a women who wants to recapture her fading beauty makes a deal with devil and takes some supplement finds herself needing more to keep up with the beautification facade and then finds herself turning into a monster only realising by the time her body has started to degenerate she was in too deep?

Again, this is all guesswork on my part, but it seems a logical conclusion to the trailer and the way the film looked like it could play out.

What message do u mean, mate?  Multiple pilot points being hammered home? And what about the plot did you find interesting?

And I don't mind spoilers if you would like to give me a brief synopsis or your review of the fillm and plot.

I spose there's plot holes in every film if u look hard enough.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"See I took it to have a different meaning. The meaning I got from this film was society in general values youth and beauty in females much more than age and wisdom. The tv execs, film execs are always looking for the younger more bankable female rather than one who's like you said sacrificed and put in the years only then to be put out to pasture.

Another poster made a brilliant analysis on cosmetic surgery and the substance and again looking to continue to drain that fountain of youth long after its run dry. 

I saw Elizabeth as a self centred, narcissistic individual who's only reason for living was herself and her dreams and when she didn't achieve them she saw the cheat code and grabbed it. But unfortunately the old saying cheaters never prosper came back to haunt her.

The fact that the video and voice kept saying you are one interested me because I thought ironically the substance seemed a lot to me like power it should never be given to people who seek and and those willing to say no would probably have more of the mindset to use the substance properly but maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe the substance is always doomed for failure regardless of who takes it because its hardcoded in most of humanity to be selfish and take more than what's needed especially when it's offered on a platter.

I like your analysis too tho. That's why I love films like this. They can mean so many different things to people and none of them are wrong if thought throught critically enough.

All it needs is a good story and someone to pull the trigger.

I was always that kid. If u told me to do something, I'd do the complete opposite 😆 🤣 and I'm 40 now, and I haven't changed and don't plan on starting yet. I do believe as a society we are all far too obsessed with beauty and pretty people when in actuality some of the most attractive people I've met have turned out to be some of the most boring people I ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Whether there's a correlation between highly attractive people say not having to work as hard as the rest of us I dunno but it's a sound theory. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that every attractive person has the personality of a goldfish but some of the most amazing people I've ever met certainly weren't 8's or 9's in the beauty department lol 😆 

It's kinda like the analogy of rich people never having to have worked for anything and always being given everything so easily. Imo the struggle is what builds character and manners too I might add again some of the wealthiest people I've met have turned out to be rude and obnoxious where as people from poorer backgrounds who have had to scratch and claw for everything they've earned have turned out to be some of the nicest, kindest most caring and interesting people I've come across.

My favourite 2 parts are where >!firstly, she takes the peyote and beer can and patches herself back up. Yeah, it's a bit far-fetched surviving the fall, etc, but looking for a deeper meaning I took the cave to represent possibly that she hadn't survived and that was her descent into the inferno especially with the fire etc. But then waking up with the brand, the fact that her flesh now belonged to the devil, maybe I dunno its fun to ponder these things. Secondly, I like the scene where there both messed up at the end blood everywhere. Visibly against the tiles and floor, it's striking, but I don't know if when he slips if that was intentional, but it looked pretty real and glad they kept it in. I love what he does with the cling film or saran wrap for our us cousin's. Digging into that scene and how it plays out I interpreted it as she had to struggle so now it's his turn so that's why she takes her time with him and let's the fear build in him until its her time to strike and exact her Vengeance making her Revenge complete. Also, I've just thought of this and the 7 deadly sins analagy. I dont know if their all there, but wrath, pride, envy and sloth are definitely there im gonna have yo rewatch it now haha!<

Not even the gore felt scary. The characters were one-dimensional and almost clownish. The nudity was excessive, and despite being directed by a woman, the amounts of unnecesarry boobs felt like it was made by a horny man with zero creativity. Somehow it felt slow paced to me, even when they bombarded you with loud sounds and trippy scenes.

It almost made me feel like they thought the audience was too stupid to get the message so they had to cut to little flashbacks showing stuff (like the doctor's scar) or people repeating stuff for you to make the connection.

The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"The Substance to me always represented a manifestation of xyz product that promises to essentially cure your old age and bring back a snatched youthful body even if that's impossible. The customer service rep that she calls isn't able to care, and the people they're targeting as their userbase would more than likely be those ""susceptible"" to ""overuse"". But a question I have to ask, is wouldn't this be one of the most traumatic and also life-changing (in a positive way) event in one's life?

Could having to hide your aged body and literally stab yourself with a needle not provoke a bit of oddness? Do you think you could do any better if you were told that you're a singular person while existing in two bodies (non-simultaneously) and having to go from ""genetic perfection"" to your old less-than-perfect body? Not a judgment question but one I asked myself, would I if I didn't know the consequences of such a treatment if misused even attempt it? What if I knew? Would the foresight make me feel more confident about the procedure or just decide to live a mundane life?",2,2024-10-18 17:49:29,always represented manifestation xyz product promise essentially cure old age bring back snatched youthful body even thats impossible customer service rep call isnt able care people theyre targeting userbase would likely susceptible overuse question ask wouldnt one traumatic also lifechanging positive way event one life could hide aged body literally stab needle provoke bit oddness think could better told youre singular person existing two body nonsimultaneously go genetic perfection old lessthanperfect body judgment question one asked would didnt know consequence treatment misused even attempt knew would foresight make feel confident procedure decide live mundane life

Some moments that I can’t get out of my head:   Elizabeth laying on the floor of her shower, banging her head against the ground and repeating “stop it” over and over again to try to get  her Sue-self to respect the balance; Elizabeth almost killing Sue but stopping because she’s “the only part of me that’s lovable”; Sue kicking Elizabeth and shoving her body back in the closet while calling her a “fat, ugly bitch.”

Because NOPE). THAT said: the sound design is, uh, very good so if it's not just visual for you, yeah skip. 

For me, I'm glad I saw it because I really liked the story/writing/themes and performances. There's SO much rich material in it and things to talk about.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Okay so, respectfully, you’re missing the mark. I would argue, if anything, like countless horrors before, it is using *aging* as the horror element. You know, old people creepy and scary? However, given the theme of the film, it doesn’t seem mean spirited or even like a trope. My interpretation is that, in our youth we fear and resent aging, but as we age we fear the youth overshadowing us, we fear being forgotten and dismissed since we’ve lost our “light” and youthful appearance. This film is pretty in your face about those two selves sharing the same “being” and fighting for control. It’s not very subtle about “aging actress finds way to turn back the clock” - >! long story short they are one and can *not* be separated !< - what you’re seeing is not some reference to burn victims but a freakin lovecraftian nightmare of melded flesh. >!

These studios don’t campaign for Oscar’s, and like you said, there’s a slim chance they win, anyways.  Now let me ask you: WHY is that chance so slim? The academy, meaning the voters behind the awards, do look down on certain genres and elevate certain others. That’s why the terms “oscar bait” and “Oscar snub” exist. You can tell the kind of movies that are going to sweep awards before they’re even released. Take one look at Anora and tell me that isn’t going to take home at least one or two Oscar’s.

Edit 3: still can’t reply for some reason, I think since that other guy blocked me, u/ok_movie421 I’ve commented 17 times today, and that’s way above my average. That’s a lot for you?

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I am glad you brought that up and I think we’ve all needed to have a genuine discussion about things besides moving around it, to preface I haven’t see it but going off what I’ve read here and in general (no spoilers, I don’t know anything that happens.)

Whenever I see him or Voight in a movie now, my first instinct is to think what’s the general reason for it. They both are open with their conservative beliefs and they were in a political movie this year, all the while this movie does come across as progressive and feminist. And AFAIK from brief reading, Quaid is the only one from the cast that’s really been outspoken about politics here… so… why him? Since he is controversial, and while I can see the point where it does seem he may be playing a bad person, I do still question it.

If it’s because he’s a good actor, it still feels odd because it can contradict the movies themes in a way. If it’s because they want to get interest in conservatives watching the movie and maybe present them with progressive ideas I can also see that. Although, I’m hoping this won’t be another movie that doesn’t really have a stance. I’ve seen a lot of hostility from certain groups being hateful to Erin Moriarty, so it really does make me wonder what exactly is trying to be said, or if there’s any kind of ulterior message or reinforcement going on.

Movie theater hard drives can be cracked now? The Substance just dropped on the public torrent sites despite no streaming release date.,1728842472.0,"Highly unlikely this is from a “movie theater hard drive”, or what is known as a Digital Cinema Package (DCP).

DCPs are encrypted pretty intensely. Each reel of the film, which typically has 6 for each video and audio portion, has a unique AES-256 symmetric key. Using brute force to break just one of them would take years and years. (Depending on the calculation you choose, perhaps longer than the age of the universe for each one.) The other attack vectors would require a breakdown of security in the delivery of the asymmetric keys that the projection hardware uses to unlock the symmetric keys. If that breach did actually occur, you can be sure those projectors would be put on the distribution blacklist immediately and not receive future movies. So at most, if this was a leak by way of a DCP, don’t expect that to be possible going forward.

As for the watermark question. There is watermarking that is (typically) applied to the image and sound, at projection time, by the media block that decrypts and decompresses the media. It is applied in a way that is difficult for an average viewer to spot, but can be detected when a recording of the screen and sound is made and passed into the watermarking detection software. The watermark payload includes the serial number of the player, and the date and time the projection occurred.

If this was a rip from the DCP directly, using the symmetric keys, and NOT from a capture of the projection, it would contain no watermarking, picture or sound, as that is not encoded into the media inside the DCP.

Additionally, the DCP is in a colorspace that would need to be converted to display normally on home televisions. Not impossible to do, but easy to get wrong. It’s also in a different resolution than the one listed in the nfo. 

To echo the theory of others here, this is likely a pre-release screening rip, intended for awards considerations. As such, it may have a watermark of the original recipient, depending on the source.",4,2024-10-13 18:01:12,highly unlikely movie theater hard drive known digital cinema package dcp dcps encrypted pretty intensely reel film typically video audio portion unique aes symmetric key using brute force break one would take year year depending calculation choose perhaps longer age universe one attack vector would require breakdown security delivery asymmetric key projection hardware us unlock symmetric key breach actually occur sure projector would put distribution blacklist immediately receive future movie leak way dcp dont expect possible going forward watermark question watermarking typically applied image sound projection time medium block decrypts decompresses medium applied way difficult average viewer spot detected recording screen sound made passed watermarking detection software watermark payload includes serial number player date time projection occurred rip dcp directly using symmetric key capture projection would contain watermarking picture sound encoded medium inside dcp additionally dcp colorspace would need converted display normally home television impossible easy get wrong also different resolution one listed nfo echo theory others likely prerelease screening rip intended award consideration may watermark original recipient depending source

I think every time I’ve gone to see a horror film since then (the past 5ish years), there’s always at LEAST one toddler or baby in a carrying seat. They inevitably start crying because that’s just how little humans roll, and without fail the parents won’t leave the theater to soothe the kid. They just wait until a worker comes in because someone complained. Then it’s a 50/50 split of if they’ll leave quietly or if they’ll loud-whisper about how rude “people are these days.”


It’s fascinating to me honestly. I think I’d personally be too embarrassed and ashamed to do that because I try to be aware of how much noise I’m making, so I’m always surprised when other people don’t really care about their public perception. I imagine they just don’t want to get a babysitter and they don’t think it’ll affect their kid if their kid watches 2 hours of gore/fear. Maybe it won’t - I’m not child psychologist after all.

As a teacher, the kids who come to school at 8 years old and tell me they play Grand Theft Auto 5 all night and watched 'Insert hot horror movie with rape, dismemberment, insane gore' , are usually not the greatest. 


Give your kids a Goosebumps to read, or show em Earnest Scared Stupid.

"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"I agree with you on movies like Terrifier but kids need to learn how to handle fear the same way they need to handle other emotions like anger and sadness. Horror movies are a great way to do that in a controlled way. 

Also, kids aren't stuck in the theater. You can get up and leave anytime you want. Before I took my oldest to the movies to see one we had previously started watching Children of the Corn and he asked me to stop the movie when the couple thinks they hit a kid. I paused it and we had a chat and I said he didn't have to watch it f her didn't want to. A couple years later he came in my room one day and was like mom I am ready to try again and we watched it. I had to laugh because afterwards he was like that wasn't that scary. I was like I told you so.

So when we went to see Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and he said I want to leave I suggested he sit in my lap and wait 5 minutes and if he still wanted to leave we would. He said okay and before the 5 minutes was up he was already back in his seat and when I asked if he wanted to leave he said no. He had worked through his fear. 

Let me explain how that is helpful.for kids in real world experiences. When we first moved into our old house I had this giant bedroom and while we were fixing up his room he was staying in my room. My room had a big sliding glass door that led to a little balcony. One night I was in the living room watching TV when he comes wandering in rubbing his eyes saying someone was knocking on the door. I figured he had had a bad dream and brought him back to bed. I went back to talk to dad and our roommate and they both heard knocking but assumed it was him just messing around. I went back and grabbed my kid and the butcher knife and we slept on the futon n the living room. Well he slept as I couldn't. This went on for a few months. I did figure out it was some teens messing with us. That was until one night they messed up.and I was there for the knocking and grabbed the butcher knife and ran out the back door like a crazy person. They scattered and ran and did not come back. He was able to handle them messing with him though because I had already taught him how to handle fear. No freaking out or crying or being afraid to go to bed because mom will protect him and handle it. It would be great if kids could just be kids but the world at large doesn't care if they are kids and ad things happen to kids and as a parent you need to teach them how to deal with it.",-14,2024-09-26 02:34:26,agree movie like terrifier kid need learn handle fear way need handle emotion like anger sadness horror movie great way controlled way also kid arent stuck theater get leave anytime want took oldest movie see one previously started watching child corn asked stop movie couple think hit kid paused chat said didnt watch f didnt want couple year later came room one day like mom ready try watched laugh afterwards like wasnt scary like told went see scary story tell dark said want leave suggested sit lap wait minute still wanted leave would said okay minute already back seat asked wanted leave said worked fear let explain helpfulfor kid real world experience first moved old house giant bedroom fixing room staying room room big sliding glass door led little balcony one night living room watching tv come wandering rubbing eye saying someone knocking door figured bad dream brought back bed went back talk dad roommate heard knocking assumed messing around went back grabbed kid butcher knife slept futon n living room well slept couldnt went month figure teen messing u one night messed upand knocking grabbed butcher knife ran back door like crazy person scattered ran come back able handle messing though already taught handle fear freaking cry afraid go bed mom protect handle would great kid could kid world large doesnt care kid ad thing happen kid parent need teach deal

"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"I totally agree with you 100%, kids absolutely do need to learn how to cope with and confront fear (fear is the mind killer). Part of my respecting kids intelligence is respecting their ability to be profoundly disturbed by the things that they see and hear. My worry is that some parents think that just because their kid isn’t crying or freaking out, that they’re not being internally traumatized by the things they’re seeing, which is why I reference my poltergeist experience because I genuinely thought my brother was fine, and felt absolutely awful when I found out how it had affected him later. But just like my brother there were things I thought I was ready for that I absolutely was not, like the Shining for instance, resulting in a fear of bathtubs that carried on for quite a few years, but hey I knew what I was getting into and I could have walked away and stopped watching at any time. 

That’s healthy fear that I think every kid goes through, watching a movie that kinda has you shook for a little while, but that’s something entirely different from people taking their toddlers and such to movies that they can’t even begin to understand, let alone consent to watching on a giant screen in a loud and dark theater.

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"My favorite movie this year. The creative direction, the way it's shot and edited is nothing short of spectacular. The score is amazing and it elevates every moment of the film. The idea behind it is not new and original, but the way the story is told is fresh and uncompromising. We could probably tell where it would go from the start, but not how far it would go, and that's what makes it stand out. I wouldn't call the message shallow. Shallowness is what the movie depicts, but there are layers to the story. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the director is mocking the character and has no mercy for her. But I don't think that is the case. We spend plenty of time seeing the way Elisabeth struggles to see her value beyond the looks because of the beauty standards she internalized after years of working in the industry. I felt great sympathy and sadness for the character. It's great that this film hit the nerve and started this conversation, despite the fact that it's divisive in terms of the message and its depiction",11,2024-10-15 08:03:47,favorite movie year creative direction way shot edited nothing short spectacular score amazing elevates every moment film idea behind new original way story told fresh uncompromising could probably tell would go start far would go thats make stand wouldnt call message shallow shallowness movie depicts layer story easy jump conclusion director mocking character mercy dont think case spend plenty time seeing way elisabeth struggle see value beyond look beauty standard internalized year working industry felt great sympathy sadness character great film hit nerve started conversation despite fact divisive term message depiction

The Substance is also about a equally vapid and shsllow person the audience  is supposed to care about her and find her arc engaging for some reason, I don't get it. The satire/commentary  is as deep as a puddle of ditchwater and it lacks any of the pathos or imagination of Cronenberg or the devastating realism of addictiob parables like Requiem For A Dream. It's on the nose and broad  like the Jesus allusions in Zack Snyder film.

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"El luminoso desfile de culos es, sin duda, lo mejor de la película; sin embargo, todo lo demás resulta decepcionante. Empezando por el personaje de Denis Quaid, quien se presenta como una caricatura del típico productor /CEO/ejecutivo Hollywoodense. El cual no es más que un cliché rancio y narcisista que abusa de su posición de poder, sin aportar nada nuevo en comparación con versiones similares en otras películas.

Por otro lado, Qualley, valiendose más de carisma y atractivo visual que de buen guion, logra captar nuestra inmerecida atención con su interpretación, emulando en cierta medida lo que hizo Arnold Schwarzenegger en ""Terminator 2"". Sin embargo, llegado este punto lo único que puedo expresar como sentir de un servidor, es, lástima ante la imperiosa necesidad de la cinta de provocar en nosotros alguna preocupación por las desavenencias que se ciernen sobre la incipiente vida de Sue, el personaje de Margaret, tomando en cuenta que como ya dije no es más que un despojo unidimensional tal y como aquel robot exterminador en la película de James Cameron, pero sin las inherentes justificaciones qué hacian qué esta condición superflua en la constricción del personaje tiviese sentido en esa película.

Sin embargo, no me habría tomado ni la más mínima molestia de verter mis frustraciones en este comentario si solo esto hubiera sido lo que mis ojos tuvieron el infortunio de ver anoche. Porque a una película le puedo perdonar lo que sea, menos el arrebatarme la suspensión de la incredulidad. Si bien los efectos especiales prácticos fueron competentes durante primera mitad, una vez iniciado el clímax, se vuelven tan pobres que hube deseado tener cataratas para poder soportar la mediocridad expuesta en pantalla ante mis ojos y así no sentir que estaba viviendo de nuevo aquel doceavo y último día de reyes, sabiendo que mis padres eran los que venían a comerse las galletas qué yo ponía debajo del árbol de navidad, mientras me escribían cartas para que me portara bien y así con suerte hacerme acreedor de juguetes otra vez.",1,2024-10-15 08:03:47,"The luminous parade ass undoubtedly best film , however , everything else disappointing starting character Denis Quaid present cartoon typical Hollywood ceoejexecutive producer nothing rancid narcissistic cliché thatAbuse position power without contributing anything new compared similar version film On hand , Qualley , valuing charism visual attractiveToo bad imperative need tape provoke u concern disagreement loom incipient life Sue character Margaret taking account I said nothing one -dimensional dispossession exterminating robotIn James Cameron 's film without inherent justification condition superfluous character 's constriction , blunded meaning movie However , I would taken slightest discomfort pouring frustration comment eye misfortune see last night movie forgive less less snatch suspension suspension theIncredulity While practical special effect competent first half climax started become poor I would wanted cataract able withstand mediocrity exposed screen eye feel I living twelve lastKings Day Knowing parent one came eat cooky , I put Christmas tree writing letter behave well thus luckily make creditor"

Pero bueno, desde el inicio de la historia se tomaron bastantes libertades e incoherencias para terminar de contar la historia así que ya se veía que no iba a ser algo serio.

Finalmente, en lo que debo felicitar al director es en el hecho de que en toda la peli por más escenas sensuales y desnudos no sentí excitación en ningún momento xD estaba tan asqueado por la sobre saturación de los sonidos de tripas y las escenas de sangre y vísceras que solo podía sentir asco y pena por la mujer y su descenso a la locura.

Also, along with the thread on beauty and Hollywood, I distinctly saw the loss of her youth at having given Sue life as a parallel to cultural beauty standards overall. A woman at 60 may despise how she looks in comparison to the younger beauties on the screen and in print, but the more time spent making the comparison, the more time and beauty are lost.¬†

Elisabeth hates Sue because she‚Äôs actively sucking her life away, yet is the only joy she can feel anymore. But she still can‚Äôt stop.

I had a blast, I personally felt like it was a very dark comedy that obviously uses excessiveness and absurdity to its benefit to supplement the social commentary. This was the most fun I had in a theater all year, actually was nearly in tears laughing, but don't mistake that for a critique of this film - it's an appraisal. It had to be intentional, all the little things like suddenly introducing out of nowhere subtitles while the monster is speaking at the end - the totally over the top name for the creature in the third title card - and the fact that many characters are just straight up caricatures. It screamed to me dark comedy, but I don't think a lot of people will experience it that way. 

The biggest thing I could do without was the constant cutting back to things to bash you over the head with ""Hey, remember this? This is important!""

- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

It went places I truly wasn't expecting, and had become my film of the year so far.",70

The acting from Moore is superb, what a perfect cast for the role both as an actress and as a real life parody. She nailed it! I truly hope she wins some awards for this.

Qualley was fantastic too! And my goodness what a smoke show. Totally fit the 'perfect' other self. Guess I have a new crush! 

Genuine moments of sadness and empathy for Moore's character, wonderful storytelling. Was cracking up when she turned into the 'witch'.

Amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects! As plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie! Shout-out to Quaid as well!

Ending scene was nuts! Reminded me a little of the shock at the end of 'Ready or Not' (another fav of mine), which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of Kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding. Her dying on her star was just a fantastic callback to the beginning of the film!

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,1726799015.0,"Absolutely loved the film. It felt like a mix of Requiem for a Dream and Possessor. While giving viewers more then enough shocking gore and vile imagery, it also does an amazing job satirizing the entertainment industry and beauty standards. The scene where Demi Moore can‚Äôt go out on her date with Fred because of her constant obsession over her appearance was very sad. 

The technical elements are great too. They are pretty similar to Fargeat‚Äôs first film Revenge (2017), in terms of the way it is shot, edited, and scored. So if you enjoyed the vibe of that film, you will love this one. I believe The Substance is an improvement in every way over that film. Excited to see what she does next. Her and Brandon Cronenberg and going to be the faces of body-horror for years to come.",138
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,1727039215.0,"On one hand I couldn't help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death. Desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things don't go as planned etc etc. I remember the Facelift episode of American Horror Story and one of the episodes of Guillermo Del Toro's horror anthology having a similar bit.

But I think The Substance really killed it and made something that still felt totally unique.

The body horror was relentless and I love how they tease the feeling of dread and disgust with the constant closeups. For me one of the grossest parts was Sue getting greedy and draining Elizabeth for more and more fluid as the site got more and more infected. Then finally all that comes out is some bloody pus. I felt like I spent the entire second half of the movie with my hand over my face cringing.

It was great portraying self-hatred through literally two different versions of yourself in conflict and the inevitable climax of trying to destroy yourself. One thing I didn't like about that final fight scene was how absolutely fragile Elizabeth had become in an earlier scene, struggling to stand without breaking her knee. Now she's 100 times more decrepit and taking hits like a boxer and still standing up. I think she should have died a lot earlier to keep things from getting comical but then the vicious beating could have ensued long after to really drive home the point of psychotic self-hatred.

Seeing her reflection in the doorknob was a fantastic and sad moment. Bringing everything back to the beaten up hollywood star was a cool touch.

When the final monstro form crumbled to pieces and all that was left was her face poking out I ALMOST thought her whole normal body was going to emerge unscathed and then she'd get a banal call from the company saying the experience was complete. ""Thanks for choosing us!"" But I guess that would have been a bit too goofy for no reason.",41
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,1726806272.0,"This might be ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THIS YEAR. Holy shit, Quaid (lol ""Harvey"" I seen what you did there) stole the scene every time he was on camera, Qualley really was out to be *that* alpha bitch, Moore's self loathing doubt and her losing it after the first half of the film made me laugh ruefully for her.

The plot is makes it clear that Sue was going to sabotage Elizabeth (I thought Elisabeth was gonna get revenge given the chicken in the navel bit by way of overeating then causing her to sprout food from herself...?) but I loved it's unpredictability and descent into utter chaos at the end. The ostensible cliche phrase ""take care of yourself"" had so much weight to it, plus I love the commentary on how showbiz will chew one up and spit you out especially if you're eye candy (dear lord so many butt shots, I'm assuming commentary on the male gaze?), and also body dysmorphia and the lengths one would go for self preservation. Speaking of eye candy the chaotic cinematography is chef's kiss, I loved also when Harvey was around he would speak to the camera whether it be Sue or Elisabeth.

The end of the film with Monstro Elisasue gave me so many mixed feelings of dark humor laughter at how unhinged it was, sadness out of a fading star, and shock at the horrifying amalgamation of body parts. You couldn't help feel sorry for the Elisabeth slime's last chance at happiness as she slowly fades at her Hall of Fame star (that foreshadowing at the beginning with the burger)

The only negatives I have are nitpicks: One the slow pacing until the middle of the film, two (suspension of disbelief be damned) how in gods name did Sue become an interior designer overnight?

TL;DR The social commentary, the chaos and unpredictability, great acting, and utterly over the top presentation for the film, make it one of my favorite films of the year so far!

9/10, don't pull chicken from your navel and while I think there was social commentary to be said, Qualley's got a nice ass

People abuse substances to temporarily feel like a better version of themselves, but it always has side effects that slowly eat away at you.

One of the greatest cinema experiences I've had in a loooooong time, maybe ever, and I'm always at the movies, very up to speed with what's out and what's going on in film and horror in general.

Definitely a film that you need to see in a cinema. It could be watched, and enjoyed, at home, but it's certainly the kind of film that is really elevated by the cinema experience.

This is how I can tell that the symbols are functioning as such. I suppose that‚Äôs my most basic test for whether a movie is any good.

This is why I watch horror movies. It seems the usual method of making video entertainment is to throw in some symbols, hope something sticks‚Ä¶ And it seems that horror alone follows symbols to see where they lead, and then the filmmaker reports their discoveries honestly.

Just a few examples from the movie: the glass box in which Elizabeth lives overlooking the city, the entire bathroom lol, the hallway to the bathroom, which is inexplicably spiral inside the other otherwise cubic apartment, the hallway at the TV studio, the camera lens, the colors‚Ä¶ god that pink is oppressive!

I was so suspicious that the movie came from an intellectual/social commentary perspective. The kind of movie that would have been better as an essay. But no, this is the real deal. A dream that shakes you and stays with you.

It‚Äôs a real exercise in empathy to watch this as a man. I feel like I learned something about my species in my time and place.

Anyway, it‚Äôs a very good movie. I feel the same drive to watch it again, unpack it, look under the hood to see how it works‚Ä¶ The same way I used to with the Coen Brothers in their heyday (Barton Fink through Inside Llewyn Davis)

It‚Äôs very clever, very well-made, very true.

Being accepting and happy with how we look as we age can be difficult, especially in a world of such demanding perfection for women to remain youthful and perky, while men age, look older, without being criticized or objectified. 
It‚Äôs polarizing and this movie did an amazing job at showing what a nightmare being objectified and chasing perfection can feel like. ‚ÄúPretty girls should always smile.‚Äù Raise your hand if you cringe when men say that, and how young were you when a man first said it to you.

The way the rapid cell division took place was actually demonstrated quite well in my opinion and knowing the budget made it all the more better, the scientific aspect of the body horror made it all the more terrifying.

First, the men. All men (extras excluded) in the film are portrayed as either greddy assholes or complete simps, no in-between. Not that I was offended, of course. It just seemed that the message could be a little more subtle, more nuanced. But it kept beating over the audience head with the message ""all men in the entertainment industry wants to use womens bodies for their evil intent mwhahaha"" Dennis Quaid is awesome in the role.

Parts of the plot were a little forced. You mean to tell me a Oscar winning wealthy famous celebrity would go, by herself, all alone, into that little dingy door? Fuck that. Could be an organ harvesting room, or for kidnapping, she doesn't know!! But noooo, she proceeds without a flicker of a doubt, because plot.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,1727109101.0,"Had some time to digest this (and get to a computer rather than my phone).

I really appreciated this film for so many things (acting, practical effects, editing, score, etc.) but I really think there‚Äôs something special about the screenplay and that it really reflects a female POV that is missing from a lot of horror.

First, the real horror is so very internal. Elizabeth‚Äôs problem is not so much Hollywood or the way older women are tossed aside, though that‚Äôs certainly there, her real problem is the way she views and values herself. She is self destructive because the real problem is internal, it‚Äôs the way she views herself. She cannot see what we as viewers can see (and casting Demi Moore here was a stroke of genius) at any age, she is stunning by any societal standard‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not how she sees herself. She sees herself as haggard and a monster, and when the ‚Äúmisuse of the substance‚Äù takes a toll on her, that‚Äôs the toll it takes. It makes her appear on the outside the way she feels and views herself on the inside. That scene before the date is heartbreaking if you‚Äôre a woman because we have all experienced that dysmorphia to some extent‚Äîthat experience of being unable to really see yourself because of feelings of inadequacy. This really makes this film so different than most others‚Äîit‚Äôs not about being turning into a monster, it‚Äôs about seeing yourself as a monster.

The heartbreaking thing about Sue is that she's not a younger Elizabeth. She's someone else entirely. The best version of you (as a woman) isn't even YOU. It's someone else entirely. You were never good enough. And even the best version of you has insecurities because she's not good enough either.

Second, the narrative structure really emphasizes this. In a lot of screenplays, once Elizabeth unlocked Sue, Sue would have gone on to take down the man--- to get revenge on everyone in Hollywood who mistreated Elizabeth. But that‚Äôs not at all where the narrative goes. Because although there are many terrible characters, they really aren‚Äôt the antagonist. Elizabeth is both protagonist and antagonist. She is truly her own worst enemy, both in her Sue form but also in her Elizabeth form as she punishes herself by binging and trashing her apartment and destroying everything around herself. This could have very easily strayed into a revenge tale, and I think it‚Äôs partially the female POV that sidesteps that narrative to take the story in a different direction.¬†

Third, I love how the male gaze is used in this film. I think it‚Äôs very brave and effective. It‚Äôs not shown to be bad. It‚Äôs just cranked up to 11, and then 15, and then 200 until you are disgusted by it without being told to feel that way. All the huge close ups of bodies and body parts. Especially at the end, where Monstro Elisasue is just an amalgamation of body parts. It‚Äôs so in your face and unabashed. The end is seriously like ‚ÄúYou like tits? You want tits? Here‚Äôs another one for ya!‚Äù It makes things so sexual that they become completely UN sexual. And all the nudity is presented in the most clinical of settings‚Äîagainst a white tiled bathroom. I‚Äôve seen people say that they feel like the film falls into presenting the male gaze and I think that‚Äôs missing the point‚Äîit‚Äôs about letting the audience reject the male gaze in a way Elizabeth never really is able to. It‚Äôs wildly effective.

I see why this won a screenplay award at Cannes. It‚Äôs not only audacious and original but it has a POV that is largely absent from the genre and really deserves to be represented.

My theater was dying with laughter basically that whole last 20 minute section, especially >!when Monstro puts the Sparkle face cutout on her ""head?"" lol!< It was so awesome.

I've never had a movie make me physically react the way this did. From the moment she got The Substance, I found myself with my hand over my mouth. I could see both people on the sides of me out of the corner of my eye were reacting the same way throughout the whole movie, and I'm sure if I could see the 4 rows behind me, they were too. I've watched all the main body horror movies people talk about, and none of them got me like this.



That last 30-45 minutes is just straight up insanity. When the movie ended, I just sat there for a minute, and then I went to the lobby and sat on the bench in complete disbelief, speechless. I loved everything about it. When I saw Margaret Qualley was staring in this, I knew it was gonna be something special. She was sensational, and so was Demi Moore. I don't really know how you top a movie like this. I really believe on all levels it was damn near perfection. Maybe it could've got trimmed down just a little bit but even for a movie that was over 2 hours long, you're so engrossed in everything that's happening on screen that it doesn't even feel like it has been that long.



This might be one of my favorite movies I have ever watched, definitely one of the best horrors and by far the best theater experience. I'll be waiting for another movie to top this theater experience. Hearing the whole crowd groan and make noises and physically react was awesome.

Demi Moore was stellar. Her best performance? And I didn‚Äôt know Dennis Quaid could chew scenery so good. About as good as he chewed them shrimps. 

Like another commenter said, my theater didn‚Äôt get up when the lights kicked on. Everyone just kinda sat there in silence for a bit. I hope this film picks up steam because it might be the best theater experience I‚Äôve had with a horror movie or almost any movie in some time. It will be a shame if it doesn‚Äôt get the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Though I dunno who I would recommend this to. I feel like the average person would think I‚Äôm at best a sex pest by the middle or complete lunatic by the end. 

Question - did they share the same brain/memories at all? I thought not but it makes you think - kinda a raw deal if you don‚Äôt get to experience it at all. I suppose that‚Äôs the point, the aging movie star watching as a younger version supplants her. But if you don‚Äôt get the memories or ability to live through your younger self directly I don‚Äôt think many would take the substance. I know they must share something somehow due to the chicken dream though. 

Also I was CACKLING during the climax. And the over the top dance. I think it made a lot of people in my theater uncomfortable (both scenes really) and I and my wife had to be the only people openly laughing out loud. The cut to the child previously so excited sobbing and covered in blood made me laugh even more. I need to watch this again.",40

Also this is the second movie I've been to (first being Log Legs) where the wife of an old couple just loudly narrated the whole thing to her husband and I don't think it was the same couple.",81
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,1726948663.0,"I've just come back from watching it and I absolutely fucking loved it. I'm a huge fan of body horror films, and special effects guys like Brian Yuzna. This does not hold back.

The first two acts are relatively sedate and take a while to get going but the sound design is phenomenal. Every act gets a sound which is amped up. Inserting a needle gets a squelch. Eating a shrimp gets a crunchy squelch. Even down to the shoes that Quaid character has have these steel heels so he just stomps down the hallway.

The third act is what's going to have everyone talking though. That's where the training wheels are fully off and it goes absolutely crazy. At one point it looks like everyone is at a GWAR concert with the spraying of blood into the audience.

There is commentary there about how women in this industry are highlighted, used and then spat out but I liked how it didn't preach about it, you could argue its almost quite reserved about it in truth. Small parts like the first time Sue walks down the street people step to the side for her to when Elizabeth does a day later and people are virtually bumping into her.

Demi Moore is phenomenal in this. I don't know if a body double was used at times and I don't think brave is the right word as it sounds almost patronising but she shows a lot. To have a camera pointed at you to show where you've aged and how things get lumpy and bumpy especially when you were known to be absolutely beautiful must have been hard for anyone to do. I wonder if the fact that it was a female director that Moore took this part on. The film works on another level too because the focal point is Moore, and her history of surgery and chasing youth.

I'm so glad to have seen this on a big screen. The only downside was how few people were there. I've read online of people being in packed cinemas where people were dry retching. 

4.5/5

TL:DR loved it, was grossed out. Going to see it again tomorrow",29
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,1727041298.0,"Watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it. 


The first 60 minutes are a fantastic drama/scifi adjacent take on womanhood; that alone was gripping. But there were cracks in the glamour. You could feel how defeated Elisabeth was. Demi acted her fucking ass off. 


Then the next 40 minutes manages to tell a gripping story of a woman who so desperately yearns for youth that she creates an entirely new person. Not a younger version of herself mind you, just a completely new person. A *better* person. Sue begins to ascend and realizes how ‚Äúsad‚Äù Elisabeth is and grows disgusted of her, turning her into nothing more than cattle for her to take youth from. 


That alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just Hollywood. Also shout out to Coralie for having a real reason for showing off Sues body; it‚Äôs over the top for a reason and doesn‚Äôt feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror - it has purpose and meaning. 



Then you have the last 30 minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie I‚Äôve ever seen. This is Society meets The Thing meets The Fly wrapped in a Barbie bow. The monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out Elisabeth head taped on. It‚Äôs just so ridiculous and absurd and it *works*. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs so many metaphors I‚Äôm missing, but I did think that the end where she‚Äôs literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period. Maybe that‚Äôs off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me. 



This movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, Demi Moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of American culture around women in general.

- Dropping the title card in the middle of the instruction video is genius! 
- Coralie Fargeat's directing is exceptional. I couldn't look away even disgusting things are happening on the screen. 
- The first act is slow paced but once the split happens, the movie gets crazy.
- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me. The car crash with no injuries, the chase in the house (reminded me of Coralie's previous movie, Revenge), Sue having great strength, the monster putting on earrings, and the endless blood spray.

So are we to understand that they were a duplicate consciousness? As in like, Sue was basically a second Elisabeth on the inside with all her memories and motivations?

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,1727864393.0,"I have a hot take. The film wants us to feel heartbroken for Elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she can't help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change. The implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards. Judging by people's comments here (""no, honey, you're so beautiful!""), it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way. This troubles me. I think it's really the wrong message from this film. Elizabeth's core mental illness from the start was not her self-loathing; it was her self-obsession. Everything about her life was completely and utterly self-absorbed. (She makes Donald Trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison.) Trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful (or great) they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin. The thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasn't, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful; it was her need for human connection. And no amount of feeling beautiful and self-love would have lead her (and in fact did not lead her) to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be self-absorbed. The deeper moral that this film missed is: Being self-obsessed is unhealthy‚Äîa meaningful life comes from caring about others.",17

But my main gripe is that I don‚Äôt understand Elisabeth‚Äôs motivations AT ALL. Why did she go through this process when the end result has no benefits for her?

We establish that Elisabeth aligns her self worth with her looks so the logical through-line is that she‚Äôs willing to do anything to feel beautiful again, but the substance only makes a younger and better looking clone of her. Elisabeth does not experience anything Sue does, she‚Äôs basically in a coma whenever she trades places. So what‚Äôs the point?

I could maybe see that she would want to live vicariously through Sue like a parent might do, but Elisabeth resents Sue from the beginning and her presence only makes her feel worse about herself. 

Then I thought maybe she‚Äôs willing to do this since she needs money and can‚Äôt sustain her way of life since she‚Äôs too ‚Äúold and unattractive‚Äù to do her previous job, but the film never makes a note that she‚Äôs struggling and even if she was fired from her job I assume she‚Äôs made enough over the years to live comfortably. 

Also, why was Elisabeth so distraught when Sue didn‚Äôt respect the balance and made Elisabeth age more by not switching in time? Elisabeth didn‚Äôt have friends or hobbies and when she was in control she stayed in the house all day. If she was already unhappy with the way she looked, then I‚Äôm not sure why becoming uglier would affect her so much.  

I‚Äôve seen this type of idea put on screen before where a woman does something drastic to regain/attain beauty but then it goes wrong and the end result is that she‚Äôs worse off than where she started. If the point of this film was just to make a gory film spectacle like Terrifier that‚Äôs not meant to be analyzed or hard to think about, then at least make it shorter (the run time was kinda long). It would‚Äôve had the same result and shock value imo. 

Someone please tell me if I‚Äôm missing something? I personally think character motivations such as this can‚Äôt really be swept under the rug since it‚Äôs the catalyst for literally everything that happens in the movie.

Tldr; Elisabeth‚Äôs motivations for taking the substance were unclear to me since none of the results seemed to benefit her in any meaningful way.",11

Tactical editing and punctuated sound effects gripped me from the get-go and once the ball gets rolling that sense of curiosity successively builds into a truly satisfying climax. Something so hard to watch yet even harder to avert your attention from. Emotional weight unleashed with no hesitation. Felt like a Lynchian pastiche (super imposed flashbacks, dramatic sow motion, uncanny character acting, Hollywood de-glorification) if it was shot by Kubrick. The film is a bit ‚Äúblunt‚Äù on what it‚Äôs trying to communicate. Didnt give me a whole lot to piece together or carefully consider once the credits rolled the way Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway did, but it sacrifices that for a focused sense of immersion.

I'm not denying the fact that the world they live in is run by a skewed lens where certain bodies are commodities in an extreme way (compared to ours lol), so it would make sense for there to be ""gratuitous"" body shots, but so much of it is how much Sue loves her body and we just get to be along for the ride. 

It forced me to rethink how I viewed those shots, like it was all self-love.

From what I understand, she and Sue do not share a consciousness, based on the fact the other is always surprised when they ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and see what the other was doing that week (ex: Elisabeth cooking all that food and leaving it the apt a mess). So it‚Äôs not like Elisabeth can bask in the glory of Sue‚Äôs success, since she has no mental or emotional connection to what she‚Äôs done to accomplish her achievements. So when the person on the phone tells Elisabeth she can quit, why wouldn‚Äôt she quit? It‚Äôd be like your friend getting all these accolades and living your dream and all you can do is watch from the sidelines, festering in your own jealousy. 

However, I am also unsure about the ‚Äúsharing a conscious‚Äù thing as when Elisabeth is in the diner, that old man confronts her and she realizes it‚Äôs the young guy from the doctor‚Äôs office who gave her the info on the substance. The old man knows who she is and seems to have the memory of the young guy meeting her and giving her the substance info. So it seems the man shares a consciousness with his other?

But then how do we explain the fight?

Because if it's more of a cloning scenario I find it hard to believe Elisabeth would be counting the days to be Sue again since for her it would essentially just be a week-long nap, but again...how did the fight work?

Why do people engage in all a manner of self destructive behavior like taking drugs or excessive gambling... because it feels good in the moment. Sue and Elisabeth are the same person. They wanted to be young and beautiful and loved. The moments of being happy seemed worth the moments of being bitterly unhappy. In the end, maybe it wasn't worth it. But it wouldn't be the first time someone chased the promise of being happy even when it was clear there would be costs.

Put another way... take a real like example. Jennifer Grey was succeeding in Hollywood, making money and booking good gig. She got cosmetic surgery thinking it would make her ""better"" and instead it made her so unrecognizable that it derailed her career. Why would any person go through the pain, risk, $$$ etc. for cosmetic surgery. Because they person tells themselves it will be worth it, they will be ""better."" But it's always a lie. You can never reach perfection because it's always off in the distance no matter how fast you run.

People do this every day-- hair implants, extreme diets, cosmetic surgeries, weird beauty treatments, etc.

Elisabeth didn't realize how deep her own self loathing went. She thought she'd be happy in both personas, and that it was enough. Turns out she was wrong.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,1729145070.0,"I loved this movie bc it‚Äôs making several different commentaries simultaneously.

There‚Äôs also just a thread that highlights the inner monologue of an insecure person, and the brutality and self-sabotage we all inflict upon ourselves. We‚Äôre our own worst enemy, right?

But the most poignant theme for me is the commentary on addiction. I‚Äôve had struggles with that before, and to me, this was actually the main theme of the movie. The phone pinging with messages like ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù while Elizabeth sits in darkness was too real. Or when she‚Äôs laying in the shower, banging her head on the floor saying ‚Äústop, stop‚Ä¶.‚Äù I bet a lot of people know exactly what that feeling is like. I know I do. Glad I‚Äôm not there anymore. 

The whole concept of someone recklessly stealing time and physical health from themself is all about addiction to me. The self-hatred, the isolation, and the diminishing returns all ring true. The idea of slowly killing yourself while pretending everything is fine is something most addicts can resonate with.

In terms of what is shown in the movie, we clearly see a transference of perspective when Sue is ""born"" and the whole 2001 sequence occurs smashing into her first person POV. I took this as Elisabeth's consciousness being transported literally into Sue, so the same consciousness is operating for each week period in whatever body has been animated. I think the movie makes it unclear because we see Elisabeth and Sue both call the Substance company to complain about ""her"" actions, but I think this reflects the way that Elisabeth/Sue are unable to see the alternative body as belonging to them for various reasons that I can't fully articulate. Elisabeth cannot overcome her resentment even though she **is** Sue, and Sue doesn't seem able to see herself as Elisabeth; she steals the stabilizing fluid even though it's damaging the version of herself that...I guess she'll become? (It's **definitely** unclear what would happen if this situation didn't implode within the few months the movie spans IIRC; would Sue age into Elisabeth? Would she age at all?

I'd like to add on to it if that's alright- not because I think you're wrong, but because I think it shows how the film can mean different things to different people depending on where their own insecurities/ traumas lie. I haven't struggled with addiction in quite the way you have, but I have struggled with eating disorders, and that's what the film reminded me of.

To me, the film was very about eating disorders- especially bulimia. She wants to stop, but she can't. She wants the 'good parts' without the 'bad parts'. A lot of people with bulimia view the binge-eating as the issue, and the purging as a natural consequence- part of recovery is learning to keep eating normally *even if you binge*. You have to love / accept yourself in all parts, even when you eat and you're fat and you're old and you hate it. But I don't think we ever see Sue eat, do we? We only see her exercise- we only see her *burn* calories, not take them in. Food is a source of horror to her, from the dream with the chicken leg to having to clean up after Elizabeth. *She* has no issues throwing the food out. To me, she represents purging/ restriction/ the goal of thinness, while Elizabeth represents bingeing/ losing control/ the body and habits that haunt you. 

Hearing them scream ""You have to control yourself!"", Elizabeth wanting to stop but being unable to, Elizabeth describing Sue as ""the only part of me that's loveable"", Sue calling Elizabeth fat and old, the binge-eating not even being properly *shown* because it's too shameful to acknowledge head-on, Sue having to 'deal with the consequences' of Elizabeth's binge eating, the constant reminders that you can stop at any time but you can't undo the damage you've already done, the teeth damage (common with purging), the fucked-up finger (can happen with purging), the desperate desire to split the part of you that is thin and pure and capable of control from the part that eats and wants and needs, Sue teling Elizabeth 'eat slowly' and failing to give her the nutrition she needs,  so much vomiting until she's throwing up her own *self*, both of them only achieving something close to happiness when Elizabeth is freed from her body completely...

It's also the rare horror movie that swings bigger and bigger all the way to the end. It really goes for it, and whether or not you think it's fully successful, you can't deny the ambition and execution and the sheer spectacle of it.

Definitely one of the best horrors of the year but could have been cut to avoid unnecessary callbacks and therefore long ass scenes",5

The acting was great, but the film itself just didn‚Äôt do it for me. The super close ups of something with a bass beat drop or gross noise got old quick, and as much as I liked the effects in the beginning of the film, what we saw near the end was so comically bad it took me out of it. At one point Demi Moore looked like Spike Jonze as an old woman from the Jackass movies. I think there were a lot of cool parts to the film though, just presented poorly and with no restraint. I‚Äôm just a spoiled film snob that‚Äôs seen everything though. Some late teen/early 20 year old is going to see this movie and it‚Äôs going to be their gateway to looking for more messed up films, and that‚Äôs ok with me.",6

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,1727091208.0,"I think it was good but less emotionally engaging than i would have liked. It felt like the principle desire was to get hurridly to certain scenes without really investing in the moments in between. This meant I felt a bit disengaged apart from the obvious shocking bits. 

I think the concept of a ‚Äúyou are one‚Äù is very interesting and I think can lead to misconceptions about what is going on. I think Sue is more of a child of Elizabeth than a conscious sharing being but Elizabeth allows and wants Sue to continue in the way a parent may continue to support a child as much as they lose their own life and individualism (eg a parent drops their kid off for soccer practice).

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,1727047227.0,"Spectacular.

I attended a scream unseen screening the other week, and was overjoyed that it was The Substance, a film I've been excited about since I saw a brief teaser trailer, and as a big fan of Revenge, I was very excited, although after Long Legs failed to deliver, I was wary of letting myself get too hyped for another horror film this year, and expectations were tempered going in.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

Just finish seeing it a half hour ago in the theater.  My my initial thoughts: 

Holy god. 
One of the years best, easily. But holy god.

- so many Kubrick references and homages, as well as DePalma and Lynch. And Cronenberg . Both Senior and junior. Even a little Billy Wilder.

- I hope Demi Moore gets recognized for an absolutely fearless performance.

- Best make up and special effects - much of it had to have been practical - I've seen this year.

- holy god

- what is it with French directors and surreal, absurdist body horror? Feels very much in the spirit of Titane.

I think the term Cronenbergian is used a bit too much in regards to body horror, but the satirical style of this really reminded me of the likes of Crash and Videodrome, particularly in regards to the growing prosthetics and makeup. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were both great, although Dennis Quaid stole the show in his scenes. 

There‚Äôs a real conflict of the horror and humour at times - the cooking/ chat show scene walks the thin line between the two perfectly. And there‚Äôs a good deal of fear factor and tension aside from the body horror elements. Certainly a lot to unpack here, and I look forward to doing so.",17

The impossible beauty standards that become internalised, the male gaze and misogyny, fear of ageing and the loss of identity when losing your career due to nothing other than being seen as too old, lack of self-confidence in your value beyond how you look, the consequences brought to your later self by selfish choices and not caring for the impact or for your future wellbeing, the fear of abandonment and desperate need to be loved ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just what hit a personal note, let alone the rest!

(And one element I‚Äôve not seen discussed yet is that of the role of Elizabeth as the ‚Äúmother‚Äù, and very much like the pushy beauty pageant moms that make their kids live out what they never could or to relive their glory days through them.)

Dennis Quaid was great but his character was probably the only bad part of the film as thet went overboard with the stereotyping.

However, with all the older films being shown, I saw Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Spidey Homecoming and Batman Forever yesterday, and Star Wars 3 then Substance today. Next weekend, there's about 6 films vying for my attention.

Anyway, I hadn't read up anything about the film so had just seen the trailer, but to say it was weird is an understatement. It was like a Cronenberg film, but without the name, albeit quite a slow start that I'd mostly skip over if I was going to watch it again. I'm toying between 8.5-9/10.

Plus, the same female director made 2018's brilliant Revenge, which hand plenty of gore, and is basically the ‚ÄòKill Bill‚Äô that Tarantino should have made, as I thought those two films were lacking overall.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,1725962223.0,"A great experience but I don't think it's a film that I'm likely to revisit. It was enjoyable but didn't have as much to say as I wanted it to.

As many have said, The Substance isn't concerned with subtlety or nuance.  It's got one point to make, a sledgehammer and some inspired body horror.

There are obvious comparisons that can be made, but the one I'm stuck on is Under the Skin. I think they share a lot of the same DNA - bold, bonkers, divisive and heavily stylised. I love to rewatch Under the Skin though. It speaks to me in a way that The Substance didn't. 

I appreciated the satire but I don't know how successful it was. It's a film about the male gaze but it never subverts that - it's just very male gazey. It wants to satirise figures like Harvey Weinstein and Vince McMahon, but Harvey gets no comeuppance, instead he gets a lot of laughs. It wants to satirise society's insane reactions to women aging but turns Demi Moore into a monstrous hag who becomes insanely jealous of a younger woman's success and then dies horrifically.

I'm glad I saw it. I had fun with it. It ticked so many boxes for me (show me gross shit accompanied by noises that make you feel like you're losing your mind, I'm normally happy). I'm not sure I thought it was a great film though.",1

Third act was easier for me to stomach completely, much easier for me to stomach compared to that anxiety inducing second act.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,1727090865.0,"SPOILER ALERT
I'm not a guy who particularly cares about morals in media, but imo the message of the film conflicts somehow with how it is described in the reviews: in the narrative world the substance can be used indefinetly if applied as prescribed (""maintaining the balance""), a fact which avoids an honest reckoning with the ultimate futility of maintaining immortal beauty/control of bodily functions. so it boils down to the following: the failings of the users is an individual fault, and the elizabeth/sue monstrosity in the grand finale is an object of ridicule. - so I think the film somehow fails in this regard. with it's handling of topics of sexism, ageism in the industry, body shame, reproduction etc the movie is somehow clustered and all over the place, a lot of cool ideas and allegories half-exposed and discussed. - this out of the way: I think the movie is great at conveying the bodily horror technically, it's male gazing zooms on frantically swinging hips and oozing wounds. Moore's performance during the first half (when the tone of the movie strikes a better balance between the comic and the tragic) is superb - contrast it to the scene where she cooks and watches Sue in the tv, where the ""comedic"" and audience distance took way overhand imo. qualley's performance is great too, but I quickly got fed up with the shots on her - the technical critique of the male gaze gets repetetive quite fast imo. really enjoyed the sound.

I find the quieter shots on Moore's body really interesting: thematizing cosmetic surgery. her lips in the wakeup shot, her buttocks when she's about to take the activator.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,1728206064.0,"I loved the movie. Yes it was way too long and the pacing wasn't perfect, but the atmosphere it creates is intense. The cinematography is also spot on. The two leading ladies carry the whole movie. Good use of prosthetics.

The most disturbing scenes are not the violent or body horror ones which are not even that intense, but the fear of ageing and the obsession we have for the passing of time, opportunities, fame/exposure and our past selves. The scenes where Demi looks in the mirror and then compares herself to Sue and constantly touches up her make up and her outfit are so heavy and everybody I think can relate, especially people past 25 who are starting to see the signs of ageing and the first changes in their appearance, men AND women.

The moments where she is hopeful and then everything turns for the worst well represents the risks and foolish things people are willing to take and do to look young. And it can be anything: drugs, diet, digital filters, fillers, surgery, fake teeth, fashion choices...

I hoped the feminist elements wouldn't be as pronounced as I think this is, in different ways, a universal experience especially in our modern social media mediated times. But the meta element of an ageing celebrity played by someone who was recently scrutinized for her facial procedures and looks was also a boss move on Demi's part.

Another detail that I found disturbing was the lack of information provided with the substance: it really captures today's beauty market so well with tons of energy based and at home devices and products that are sold with little care and scientific studies and people use them with little guidance and knowledge... a growing phenomenon is severe facial fat loss induced by microcurrent, lasers and radiofrequency devices. This was captured flawlessly in how Elizabeth jumps on The Substance with little hesitation and little care for the whole process, even when things starts getting weird. And the meth addict symptoms were poignant as well.

As for the finale, I loved the camp ending, it helps balance the uneasiness of the central/later part of the movie but I guess there were a couple of other directions the movie could have gone and explored so even if it is not a masterful scene per se, it was able to surprise me. But it was a fun scene that clearly pays homage to a cult classic and gives a strong statement about how, at least in hollywood but in modern times in general, the ""audience"" is what feeds this narrative and this obsession for beauty and youth, so everybody is guilty in the end and the whole splatter thing is a release of all the nasty emotions embodied by the monster. 

In the end, it's one of those great movies that stay in your head for a while and create a sense of uneasiness but also offer a chance for profound thinking, and it is technically well done and effective.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,1728492914.0,"This is if Cronenberg, Lynch and Verhoeven made a movie but more visually striking than Refn. This movie is the definition of unapologetic. I was not ready for how much everything escalated by the end, and the movie was not shy or subtle about the points it was making. I was blown away by the starking visual contrast between ""beauty"" and ""ugliness"" and yet the movie made them both gross and sexual at the same time to ultimately expose us, the viewers, for our unhealthy gaze.

The substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves. The paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless. This is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm. We wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder! It shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions. We are covered in our own blood. The walls are covered in blood.

Yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody. Every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character. We see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain.

Our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too. And she does not hold back. Yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd. The comedy in this movie is absolute gold. The villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious. The absurdity of this movie is so refreshing.

In terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate. It is never stagnant, but it's also not in a rush. After all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage.

This is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped. My only note would be I wish they didn't do the hamfisted voice overs at the end. I know most viewers would have missed that point. But I don't think it would have taken away from the movie. Maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as Easter eggs for the second watch. Really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience. 9.8/10.

To me, I've never seen a movie quite like this, and mad props to Fargeat for executing something so personal with such a high level of artistry and confidence and Moore and Qualley for allowing themselves to be so emotionally and physically vulnerable to put this on screen. For as darkly funny as much of this movie is, it's really got a big emotional heft, and Moore carries a lot of that with her performance and walks the balance of the emotional part and the absurdist black comedy so well. It can be a tough watch, not just because of the gore really, but honestly because Moore's character almost feels like she's at war with herself. Her character's self-hatred and self-abnegation is just crushing to watch on screen. In a lot of ways, the movie feels so much like a psychological horror movie as well before it goes full on body horror extravaganza in the final act. I really think that is because we are so pulled into the interiority of Elizabeth/Sue, to the point that the movie even switches to their first person perspective in several instances. 

I personally loved the ending; for me, it was like pulling the release on a valve and just releasing the pressure on all these heavy emotions and ideas building throughout the movie and almost was like a relief. Oddly enough, I actually found the ending to be the least nauseating; it was just so outlandish that it just kinda became hysterical and full-on satire at that point. The movie up to that point just has this heaviness and tension to it because you really do feel sorrowful for what Moore's character is experiencing; the final sequence just feels like one giant fuck you and condemnation to the whole hollywood culture around youth and beauty and like the ultimate way to ridicule it.

The first 2/3 of the movie definitely had my stomach churning at certain points (surprisingly the worst being watching Dennis Quaid eat shrimp). A lot of the food stuff in particular was just so nasty to me. I think people will be surprised about the moments in this movie that are emotionally disturbing and anxiety-inducing. Moore's scene in front of the mirror where she just kept going back actually made me so anxious because the self-doubt and emotional turmoil was so relatable, and you can feel the desperation and sadness she is going through. The body switch sequences were almost clinical and I felt like it just tapped into all these anxieties and fears around watching our bodies deteriorate and being poked and prodded by doctors as we get older. And Qualley's dance sequences were just so uncomfortable with the music and the camera movements. I was just really amazed how this movie almost felt like it was breathing through the screen with a lot of the textures and sounds. The sound, set design and makeup are just superb and just make this film such a sickening joy to watch. 

Maybe it's hyperbole, but to me it really feels like one of the most unique visions I've seen in a film in a long time. I really can't wait to watch it again, the first time is such an assault on the senses that it's definitely hard to process this film in one go.",1

I was sort of frustrated that she didn't have any friends or family in her Elizabeth Sparkle time period.  No siblings, long-term friends, anything like that.... and of course ugly people have friends too - maybe not as many - but it went to show that it reminded me that you need to make an effort and that fewer people care about what you look like (when you aren't a total monster...and even if you are, it's probably not your fault).

The Substance is a high-budget B-grade film purporting to critique Hollywood, sexism, aging ostracism, and the overall beauty industry. However, its execution feels reminiscent of a self-indulgent adolescent's misguided attempt at profundity.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,1726267087.0,"One or two moments of flashing and fast lights - largely just after The Substance itself is taken and the ‚Äòother self‚Äô is unveiled. Also as one of the central characters‚Äô grows more famous there may be occasional moments of paparazzi-like camera flashes, although these are somewhat infrequent. The BBFC does have a photosensitivity warning on its website for the film though, which is usually a fairly good indicator.

Not sure if it‚Äôd have a similar effect, but there‚Äôs also some pretty rapid editing here and there. A car crash scene early on and also during scenes where a fitness/ workout show is being filmed (actually may also be some flashing lights as part of this). Third act in general also might have combinations of both due to some of the events and settings, where the combination of things might just make everything seem that bit more intense(?), but obviously no spoilers. 

Overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there. I think generally though, if you‚Äôve seen the trailer in the cinema (which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts) that might give you a good indication of what some of the film‚Äôs sequences might be like?

The message was so surface level and in your face. They did nothing to subvert it, just had excessive close ups of ""look at this old haggard woman of 50! Now look at the hot 20 something!"" which it plays straight for so long that by the time we get to the over the top final third, I was just waiting for it to be over and couldn't even bring myself to enjoy the batshit body horror I came for. Like we are supposed to think the characters pursuit of youth and beauty is foolish, even though in the weird make believe reality of the world life is over for a 50 year old Demi Moore, forced to hide away in her home and gorge herself on meat because she's past her prime. 

There was 0 characterisation beyond ""she's old and ugly therefore sad"" and ""she's young and hot therefore happy"". Which made me utterly unable to engage in her plight. Was surprised to find it was directed by a woman, because I could have sworn whoever responsible for that claptrap had never met a woman in their lives.

I don't think it was the weed since high tolerance. But I definitely felt anxious throughout and I don't think the weed was the source as much as I'd love to claim it was for my ego's sake. Definitely was one of the most anxiety inducing moments I've seen in any film. 

EDIT: Noticed I didn't say what scene it was, it was the splitting scene.

Monstro Elizabeth was grand for me, totally grand. Can't do needles though nor could I hack her sewing Elizabeth back together, came back after my smoke during the sorta realization that she needs to 1000% switch body back to her old self, missing most of the parts where Sue is living her best life.

Kardashians. Killers. BBLs. Bloody murder. Same shit.

That final act. When the monster or poor woman bathes the entire audience in her blood is a visceral representation of all the blood that has been shed for the sake of beauty.

Sure, they took it ""too far"". Just as expected model measurements take it too far. Just as Hollywood standards take it too far. Just as the male gaze takes it too far. Just as ""locker room talk"" takes it too far.

This movie makes a point and not in a ""she could be hotter if she spoke less"" kind of way but in a ""break your nose just to make the point sharper"" kind of way. In a ""suck the fat out of your midsection and deposit it into your ass then make you lay on your face for a month while your body recovers from the cleaving"" kind of way.

The art of butchery for the sake of beauty. In today's world, you can't have gorgeous without gore.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1726977286.0,"Really great film. Can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

I know it‚Äôs a satirical, humorous, and overt message about aging, beauty standards, and the male gaze but despite the campy tone at times I actually found this movie to be quite sad at its heart.

Demi Moore hasn‚Äôt been in many projects in years and is now in her early 60s. For her to do this indie left of center French horror film when she doesn‚Äôt have to‚Äîto be this aging character that had been put out to pasture‚Äîi just found her performance really courageous and vulnerable. 

The scenes with her alone as Elizabeth were heart breaking to me especially when she stands her date up because of her self hatred towards her appearance. And how she falls further into isolation and depression due to her compare/despair mentality and how invisible and ugly she perceives she is. I actually teared up at times because I saw myself in certain parts. Like how many times I‚Äôve changed clothes before I date, looking in the mirror multiple times, eating junk when I‚Äôve felt sad, etc. 

I think this movie is a great metaphor about self-hatred, how it leads to addiction, and the distortions and deformations both those things cause when we don‚Äôt have a sense of self that is free from the hostile unrealistic standards of society.",59
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1725964400.0,"Yes, I saw it at Frightfest in London a few weeks back. Superb film, possibly my film of the year (Vying with Furiosa for the top spot).

The more I think about it the more I appreciate it. It just covers off so many different genres and elements in one movie - Hollywood satire, critique of beauty standards, commentary on aging in the media, how women see themselves as the approach 50, wild body-horror, dissection of misogyny, takedown of celebrity, black comedy.... it's many things.

I'm really looking forward to it getting a general release so I can see how it goes down with the general public, because that film goes pretty wild, and the trailers (up until now) do a decent job of not really giving away just how wild it gets.

Reading womens' opinions on it is going to be very interesting. All my female friends and mutuals came away incredibly positively about it.",54
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1727022616.0,"I went into this one blind. I hate how trailers give so much away. All I knew was that it was described as a ""body horror"" and people said it was twisted. 

This was probably the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years. The cinematography was beautiful. The internal struggle in Elizabeth was heartbreaking and I also related to Sue. The clear commentary on agism, the beauty standard, plastic surgery and the desperate clawing for youth was not lost on me. 

But what really made me sad in the activation stage was how Sue just left Elizabeth on the bathroom floor. Didn't close her eyes. Didn't try to move her to a more comfortable position. Didn't try to set up a cot or something for her. It was like the self hatred was palpable from the beginning. 

My only question was - they were one - but did they really remember each other's experiences? When the consciousness was being shifted back and forth between bodies, did Sue have the mindset of a 20 year old? Or was Sue/Elizabeth still a 50 year old consciousness who was desperate to be in a 20 year old body? Was that the self-hatred aspect as well? Or even just an agism of the self? Like Elizabeth didn't deserve life because she was 50?",37

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1728055727.0,"I thought it was very good commentary on body dysmorphia and addiction. I thought the film was very expertly crafted and kind of realistic in terms of how the world looks when you are dealing with those things. The way that half of the movie takes place in her bathroom, the way she always managed to keep it hidden, always closing the door just in time before anyone else can see her switch, etc just hit really hard. I was half expecting a plot twist that her original body was never really altering and this whole time she was just imagining herself like that. I actually kind of liked the ending though, or at least I can‚Äôt think of a more powerful way they could have ended it‚Äî it would have been too easy if she killed Sue and lived the rest of her life as a hermit, or if she would have killed herself which I think ironically would have been too happy of an ending. The way I interpreted it was that she could have maintained a balance between Sue and Elisabeth and it would have all been okay, but she didn‚Äôt have the willpower to do so because of how powerful the addiction and shame spiral was‚Äî she no longer cared about protecting her body, she just wanted to stay high on Sue until it destroyed her body to the point of no return. Her new lifestyle was unsustainable, and because of that she now had to live with the consequences. 

All else aside, it was also very campy and slay. Very very well shot and very good soundtrack. It was very uncomfortable to sit through in the sense that it shook me to my core. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been this disturbed by a horror movie in theaters in a long time.",12

It‚Äôs comedic, disturbing, cheesy and over the top in all of the best ways, and yet so relatable at the same time with themes of self criticism and self love. I also picked up on references to substance abuse - I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs where the movie title came from or anything of the sort, that‚Äôd be too direct and obvious. I‚Äôm in recovery myself so maybe it‚Äôs just the way my brain works lol but the way she‚Äôd have to RUN to the bathroom to extract more time from/for herself (sort of like a ‚Äúfix‚Äù) and to keep from getting sick reminded me of that, especially when she did it in order to be able to perform. 

I‚Äôm typically not one for mixing comedy and horror but this one did it perfectly; certain moments that would usually make me laugh actually made me uncomfortable and I just sat there with my hand over my mouth like ‚Äúwhat. the. fuck.‚Äù Some parts did make me laugh though which was clearly the intention. 

Demi‚Äôs performance in this is absolutely unreal. I don‚Äôt remember her being that good?? The cooking scene while she‚Äôs watching the interview is gorgeously disgusting, infuriating and hilarious. I forgot for a minute that I WASN‚ÄôT watching Jessica Lange in AHS. I started to really feel for her as the movie progressed and she began to hate both (all?) versions of herself more and more. I think a lot of people can relate to the mirror makeup scene, followed by what I interpreted as a depressive episode with isolating, ditching plans, not taking care of yourself; in other scenes also the overeating, increasingly negative self talk, LOT of mental health and external/internal validation themes. When Elisabeth and Sue started treating each other like shit, saying really terrible things and literally fighting ‚Äúeach other‚Äù (fighting herself), I was like ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not very good positive self talk.‚Äù And the bells went off when I realized it‚Äôs not far off from how I sometimes talk to myself.

It reminded me of a mix between the movie Looker (1981) and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Carrie (1976) (won't say why so I don't give spoilers away and a bit pressed for time). I think the movie is an omen to the rising vapid influencers and similar who are doing just about anything to beautiful and relevant. It was symbolic of how we have a fight we being authentic and yet having everything we think is valuable such as youth and beauty but those things don't last and are missing something deeper. In the end it points how we've lost the way and destroy ourselves to the point of being like a cancer that nobody wants.

Fantastic cinematography and sound design hindered by a derivative plot. It felt like it was trying to do what black Swan did, except the themes of anorexia and ocd are replaced by themes of aging and, well, Hollywood. I really enjoyed the body horror segments but couldn't really get behind the pathos, especially considering how it felt like a more shallow version of Black Swan.

In my showing the film was preceeded by a trailer for A Different Man starring Adam Pearson, an actor with elefantitis. This kept playing in my mind during the final scene and what was supposed to portay a physical representation of the pain of Moore's character felt like a mockery. Perhaps this was a case of bad timing or perhaps it said something about us as an audience. I found this quite fascinating and it made me question my own prejudices in a way that was definitely not intended.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1730531317.0,"The substance reminds me of at least 5 top-notch sci-fi/horror films and shows. The substance gave my soul a whisper after watching.

The Fly (1988) For the Body horror, SFX makeup, and the heart-wrenching internal plea towards the end of:"" Please just kill me."" The Fly also just has these moments of being so poignant. It's ugly and beautiful all at once. Its like you could understand the cast and the decisions they make. Very similar to The Substance 

Titane (2022) Very bizarre scenes, brutal self-harm, and not being quite human and the film leaves you with the feeling of what did I just watch? 

Brand New Cherry Flavor (2021) The substance and BNCF have this weird black magic, unbelievable body contortion, and lack of explanation of how and what is happening. A similar theme of show business and desperation to make ""It"" happen. Lost of explicit sexual and just disturbing imagery as well. And lastly, something very wrong with the protagonist 

Possessor (2020) This to me has the closest resemblance to the substance to me. It is also a sci-fi, depicting a a swap of consciousness with another and the effects of it after leading into madness. Instead of seeking fame and beauty, it is for job security. (Brandon Cronenberg David Cronenberg's son). Has a Blade intro amount of blood throughout the film. It is a slow burn but boy, when it's lit it's an inferno. Very unnerving 

The Stuff (1985) This movie always is very similar to substance only it is more alien than ""Home grown by good ole humans."" The stuff truly is what it is. Just a blob, really. However this film portraits the uncanny and campy valley the substance had and most definitely showed towards the end. 

  
Side notes: Margaret Qualley looks just like Emily Denato. Is that just me? Like wtf

It has nothing to do with being a male or female - so stop being yourself, sexist and assuming that you know who or what I am... does your comment not directly contradict what folk like yourself claim to believe? But anyways, irony or hypocriticy have no meaning now-a-days. Just ego and point scoring, I supose. It has to do with whether a movie is good or not. Whether it makes sense or not. Not the cultural undertones of the day. Not what 'team' the film speaks to. THAT should not define a good movie. 

But I suppose todays' bubble culture - 'you're 100% with me or your an enemy' mindset - is hard to excape from and the 'themes' are more important than reality.

I wi concede thoughh - as in another comment that I wrote - that I do see the themes and understand the truthful point it tries to make, but it's still a pretty poor movie. I found it naff... Is that okay with you?",2
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1729597106.0,"I honestly thought it was quite a poor film. Yes, I get the undertones of Hollywood - American culture in general - always wanting younger and prettier 'next big thing', but who doesn't know that? We all know that when a woman reaches a certain age, the establishment (across the board, not just Hollywood) ousts them and brings in someone younger (why do you think that news anchors all look like plastic-skinned androids?). We know this! This film isn't anything deep or meaningful, or saying something that hasn't been highlighted a million times before... Is that the selling point of this movie and what it is hinging on? And, of course in today's world, the males are the biggest, most disgusting and most evil caricatures of a real person. Do you not think that this narrative is getting old? Planting seeds in young peoples' minds that all men are 'evil' is not healthy and leads to a confused outlook on life, based on a half-truth and today's narrative. That is not a good thing.

Back to the culture: young woman feel the pressure of an impossible perfection - again mainly thanks to America  -  but is it not a tad self-obsessed and childish, as an adult, to still be hung up on 'being young'?
Plastic surgery is horrific in of itself - weird looking, moulded cat people - and if that is a theme, then it should have pointed in that direction. If anything, the underlying story should be about the evils of going under the knife and the mindset that brought a person to that point, with the protagonist realising that they are their own version of perfect, just as themselves. 

Now for the movie itself: the story was nonsense. It couldn't stick to its own narrative and if anything, Sue was an entirely different person from Liz, like they weren't at all connected. It didn't make sense. Then, Sue wanting to abuse then kill her old self - 'the Matrix' - surely knowing that if she does, she'll also die. Surely she knew that. It's stupid. Was it a commentary or a gross-out slapstick comedy? It was all over the place.

The third act. Jebus wept. Talk about being out-of-place. Where did that come from? The gore was more extreme than a b-movie classic, but again, stupid (how much blood does a person have?). Was the film wanting us to think about the 'themes' or be grossed-out? Sad or enjoying the gore? Look for meaning or switch-off?

Just my rant.",2

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1726918591.0,"As a man in the healthcare and beauty industry: I just watched it,  didn't feel grossed out but rather more sympathetic to young and older women out here. Even the men. Also shows the egotistical women nowadays. I'm an open-minded, young gentleman. Nothing like the creepy seafood french cuisine lunatics we have running the fashion and beauty industry. You're all beautiful in your own way. 
Beauty treatments are to enhance your self image, not change it to the point that now, you're another person. It can backfire with the psychological aspect, where one can end up hating their old self, become addicted to the newer, more youthful self. We all want to be loved and appreciated by others. 

Now for the women nowadays. This term feminism is not understood by majority of women today. Creepy men are hated by gentlemen and women. Anyway, feminism has made women egotistical. They think their beauty can run the show, but in fact it's the same fitness routine. She got the job, never changed her routine yet no one noticed and preferred the young woman except the one weird nerdy guy that always liked her the way she is. Apart from the one man,   the legacy of old Elizabeth disappeared in an instant. All spoken out of hatred, by her newer self, Sue. 
My warning to all, especially extreme feminists. Respect the gentlemen, don't put them down just because they're not model looking. Oh he's 6ft, that's perfect. Shorter, ignore him and let him suffer. Oh, he's not got a great face, ewww let him suffer. So, this mentality creates more evil men, joining the shareholders group and they'll profit from your beauty and you'll turn into puppets instead. Don't become a monsto and end up looking like a mess. Respect great men. Respect great women. We all have our flaws, don't focus too much and live your life. Elizabeth was never in a relationship, Sue was abusing her looks to get the natural tall, model men. For fun. Yet it's only those men unfortunately portrayed as only caring for sex. Not everyone revs the pedal and fuels their ego,  pictured as the male Sue of today. 

Men don't put make up or utilise certain beauty treatments. Nothing wrong with beauty treatments, it's a tool to enhance, not to change.  What we do as men, is accept our heights, good 6ft or not so good (judged by both Elizabeth and Sue's of the world), accept our male genetics despite all the negativity from women like Sue and Elizabeth. Both are one. Men are put down constantly. 
So this film in my perspective, is fuelling bad feminism and once again, not realising all the actual hard work us guys have to put up with. Financially lacking, no woman wants you. No height, women (even the short women apparantly deserve the height difference lol) hate you. No muscles, skinny,  again no woman wants you. But for men outside of the film industry, we all appreciate you, young or old. Its preferences and being open minded. If you find it ewww, don't tell them they're eww, it's soul destroying. 
Don't be that old man following Elizabeth, embrace your beauty. Beauty you can't change. We can lose weight, remove wrinkles under our eyes, put make-up on to enhance, apply creams to enhance your youthful skin and maintain them. But you can't change genetics. Height is the  one thing we can't change. Sue was called little or small, can't recollect. But the creepy seafood CEO called her small, despite her being the same height as him. Sue playing with her looks so the neighbour doesn't complain, again something weak men fall for. 

So, don't be Elizabeth and Sue, in personality. Also, don't be too crazy that you see yourself as unlovable. That goes for men as well. I just found out that the woman behind this fantastic film, is a feminist. This shows, and i need to address this as no one pointed this out and saw it in her viewpoint. No one wants to acknowledge the point of view of open minded men like myself who understand this, although i love seafood... Stay safe and smile, both men and women, young and old, tall and not so tall. Mr Safology",-8

The pressure of self-harm, self-loathing, need, etc. just obliterating on stage and dousing the audience that created this monster (words from Harvey of ""creating"" perfection) was deeply symbolic because itcentered on Elisabeth/Sue's own doing in response to the vicious cycle, and the director hyper-focused on that.",17

The aesthetics, the music, the metaphors, the actors and their acting, the originality, the complexity, the heaviness of the movie, the randomness and also the comedy.
I said it was funny how some people said it's puerile because watching the movie I thought about the men in the movie are puerile and kinda stupid.

I‚Äôd also say it‚Äôs not an ‚Äòall men are evil‚Äô film, but it does point out the obvious inequalities that still exist for women in any walk of life that don‚Äôt for men. A systematic issue that still exists whether we like it or not and is proven widely (ahem gender pay gaps).

This is a film about the experience of women. Granted not all women. But many of us. 

From medical neglect, impossible beauty standards, and misogyny. 

The film is crass, gory and ridiculous yes. It‚Äôs got B movie vibes (that i personally loved). 

For me it told a bizarre-but truthful story of what it‚Äôs like to be a woman. It‚Äôs bloody, scary, complicated, competitive and sometimes fucking depressing (especially when someone tells you to smile more cos you‚Äôre pretty).

The substance was advertised as a product that would allow its user to become a younger ""better"" version of themselves. Elisabeth made sue who has the appearance of a young teenager but sue made monstro and what is younger than a teenager, a child, a lthough not physically a child, she is mentally a child. She is basically the child of sue and the grandchild of elisabeth, who wishes to carry out their dream to be on stage. A child however doesn grasp the concept of beauty or ugliness, thats why she is able to prep herself before going on stage without looking disgusted and shamlessly drag herself on that stage.

The studio to me seemed to represent the film industry, with ""Harvey"" the boss being a direct reference to an abusive, male Hollywood executive. When Elisabeth goes to use the women's toilet, it's ""Out of Order"", so she's forced to use the men's.


I wondered if this was some kind of comment by Fargeat that, as a female ""horror"" director - especially an auteur - she can't avoid being compared to iconic male directors and can't avoid using the tools and tropes that they established. There simply aren't enough female auteurs - especially in horror - to draw from. In order to reach the spotlight, she's forced to walk a path laden with the work of older, male directors.


To me it felt like Fargeat was very deliberately referencing male horror auteurs in this film, partly to pay homage and partly, in a film about how the patriarchy dominates the entertainment industry, to say ""Look, I'm forced to use these tropes established by men, but I'm going to use them, and subvert them, to convey women's experiences of that world.

I also really like the termination scene. It's her really getting rid of the addiction, but even then she just can't. I feel like I've seen or at least can imagine say an alcoholic pouring alcohol down the drain and immediately regretting it and trying to salvage what's left.",19
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,1729147043.0,"Yup!! This was my main takeway too. Not specifically Hollywood substance abuse, but addiction in general.

Binge eating and blocking out the windows. If you know, you know. Glad I‚Äôm not there anymore, but damn. It‚Äôs called The Substance for a reason. It‚Äôs Substance abuse.",11

I think at the very least that you‚Äôre correct in identifying commentary on the industry. And that there‚Äôs a reason she has to use the men‚Äôs bathroom. The safest interpretation of that is simply that it highlights the industry‚Äôs lack of support for women and the emphasis on men. 

But I think there‚Äôs definitely something to what you‚Äôre saying about having to ‚Äúact‚Äù to appeal to the male gaze. Not just physically the way Sue does but on the meta level, as well. The Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch references are almost the same thing as Sue lol. 

There‚Äôs definitely conversation to have there, whether it‚Äôs intentional or through the ‚Äúdeath of the author‚Äù view that intentionality doesn‚Äôt matter.

If it helps, I had a theory that the city design in Transformers One had skyscrapers on the ground and on the ceiling because it created a mirror-like division in the city that visually embodied the division between Optimus and Megatron and thus the autobots and decepticons. 

Ended up asking the production designer about it and he said that was actually the intention.

Cannes in general is kind of an odd place, with those reported 9 minute or so standing ovations for every movie. It's a circle jerk, this is part of it and it probably will be forgotten.

And honestly, I have no idea why movies like this, Titane or The House that Jack Built don't choose to debut at SXSW, or some other thematic festival...they could get more genre hype behind them and a well-timed release could then make them into decent/good box office hits.

I doubt this Cannes hype will last until awards season and Saoirse is kinda overdue. 

And actually, considering Emma Stone just got an Oscar for pretty much playing a sex obsessed prostitute, in explicit scenes, I think audiences/awards committees are interested or not against edgy material, but is anyone interested on awards level interested in a body horror that is another play at ""Hollywood likes only younger women?"" What is the message? Demi Moore who at 60 still looks better than most and who made her entire career on looking hot, because she never was much of an actress and she's a millionaire is questioning why she doesn't get cast anymore that much? I'm not really seeing how the business did her bad when she got 20 million I think, the then highest salary for any woman, for Striptease which was sold only on her nudity and hotness. So basically the reality is, if you're young and hot and not much of an actress, when you start getting older, Hollywood and showbiz moves on. I don't see this happening to people like Jodie Foster, Cate Blanchett, etc., maybe because they actually are good? Not sure how that's something evil.

Her subdued performance in the horror movie The Sixth Sense got her a nomination though. Even Natalie Portman won an Oscar for Black Swan. Same for Silence of the Lambs. 

Pearl definitely deserved a nomination in my eyes too but I think the performance was too ‚Äúbig‚Äù for the academy, as opposed to them not nominating a horror movie. It‚Äôs easy to just say ‚Äúoveracting‚Äù and dismiss those kinda performances.

Get Out, Black Swan, The Sixth Sense, Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist, The Omen, Misery, Rosemary‚Äôs Baby, Carrie, The Shape of Water, Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth, Sweeney Todd and Jaws all were heavily nominated or even won big at the Oscars. 

But most of those tend to have pretty subdued performances as opposed to Malignant style acting. 

It‚Äôs easy to say the academy doesn‚Äôt like horror but horror has won best picture multiple times. I think it‚Äôs more that larger than life and borderline campy horror movies are more discriminated against. Pearl, Hereditary, The Babadook, Us, The Shining and Midsommar all deserved acting noms but all those movies had actors hamming it up and I think that‚Äôs the bigger thread connecting them than just the academy not liking horror.

My take is that it is meant to view the transformation as a metaphore for cosmetic surgery - creating a split personality - one that is adored for their beauty and youth, people starting to treat you differently than before (lookism). And then there is another one, the old one, knowing that it is still same person behind the facade, with some of the same problems than before, eating disorders, realising that the new look is not all-transformative, even starting to hate the new person for being fake, fearing for the future look as the aging is inevitable. And when another cosmetic surgery (another transformation) is needed, the visual outcome may not be a desired one and there are only hints of the original person left, the rest is just a mess of flesh, out of proportion, out of place even.

I get it, if she would exist in both bodies, sharing one brain/ memory, and just switched between them. That way, she could relive her youth, which makes sense.

When Sue was out for longer than 7 days it made Elisabeth older, but when Elisabeth binge ate and lazed around it didn‚Äôt impact Sue. I also feel they could have made some things a bit more subtle, sometimes it felt like they thought the audience is just stupid so they had to hammer points in but some subtlety could have made it so much better.

So, my take was that it's still her - Sue has all Elisabeth's memories, but at the point of Sue's creation, Elisabeth's reality diverged into 2 different paths. The original Elisabeth will stay in her old body, but the duplicate of her gets a do-over. So in a way, she is still experiencing her new better reality. If she werent so vain at her core, they would have been able to exist in balance.

But as the other substance customer lamented; the 'better' version ultimately gets greedy, because it was vanity in the first place that lead them to take the substance",77
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,1726970190.0,"I think the idea that they were two different people at the end is one of the broader concepts the film was trying to illustrate. We idealize the younger, fitter and more beautiful version of ourselves to the point where it feels like ‚Äúthey‚Äù are totally separate from who we are now. Like our whole sense of identity and self worth, especially for women in the entertainment industry, is intrinsically linked to our looks and fitting the beauty standard (which is upheld by the patriarchy). 

Fighting to stop time, molding our physical bodies into what society deems acceptable through painful procedures, eating disorders, and other forms of torture, creates a massive internal conflict- Elisabeth was essentially at war with herself. 

But we are one. we are still the same person now. To preserve purity, innocence, and youth, you symbolically, and sometimes literally, destroy the version of yourself which has aged and has gained wisdom, experience, and resilience as a result.",43

Even tho she created a copy it was an exact copy of her. I'm guessing someone that's willing to take a Substance just to relive their youth would be just as reckless as a younger form ot themselves or worse as it turned out. They were the same mind, just 2 separate bodies.

All she did was create a carbon copy of her selfish self but younger, better looking, and with a younger, more devil, may care attitude. When the New Year's opportunity came up, it was what she always dreamed, so she was gonna have it come hell or high water. It was her ultimate dream.

Instead of just accepting that we all get older and when our younger year's are behind it and our curtain comes closer to being drawn she got given an option. She didn't follow the rules and well the film shows u when someone with a narcissistic individual who displays sociopathic tendencies. Though ironically, she was not the best candidate.

You are correct tho a lot of people are holding this film in high regard and one of my first thoughts wen I saw the trailer was is this gonna be another case of style over substance (pun intended :)

Ahh so wot your saying is they keep hammering home the same theme ü§î or message because and again I'm just assuming here a women who wants to recapture her fading beauty makes a deal with devil and takes some supplement finds herself needing more to keep up with the beautification facade and then finds herself turning into a monster only realising by the time her body has started to degenerate she was in too deep?

Again, this is all guesswork on my part, but it seems a logical conclusion to the trailer and the way the film looked like it could play out.

What message do u mean, mate?  Multiple pilot points being hammered home? And what about the plot did you find interesting?

And I don't mind spoilers if you would like to give me a brief synopsis or your review of the fillm and plot. Its been out for a bit now, so I'm bound to go somewhere on the Internet and have someone tell me or one of my international friends telll me so yeah I'd love to hear what u think in more detail my friend üòä",1

I also think it was a creative perspective, and its use of body horror to be provocative but appropriate. I wouldn't throw out the whole movie, but I totally agree with you that them showing every plot point multiple times *did* take away from the movie. I literally had a moment to myself where I thought, ""Fuck, is every movie going to do this shit from now on? Hit the audience over the head with the same shit multiple times because most viewers are so distracted they'll miss even the most obvious messages?""

In other words, I agree, but I guess it didn't completely ruin the movie for me.",1

I really enjoyed the film, and you can massively get behind the main protagonist who's female.

Yeah I know wot ya mean I turned 40 this year and I've got greys in me hair, me beard, nose hair lol haven't got any ear hair yet tho I think I might legit cry when that happens.

I'm quite vain , but I wouldn't say I'm a hottie either probably 4.5/5/10 on the looks front throw my personality into the mix, tho I make it to a 7 I reckon.

I think, like u said, if done well, this film can play on all of our insecurities as its human nature to want more and further seek self-improvement and even perfection (another good film, btw) dare I say it so I'm hoping simple story she takes the formula to seek perfection and then it starts playing havok on her older body so she uses it more and so on and so forth.

I wouldn't say u tripped too hard it just means you were paying a lot more attention to the surrounding aesthetics than I was. 

I spose there's plot holes in every film if u look hard enough. I thought the film on a whole where you've got Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid plus Sue whoever she's played by it came off as an indie film with that Hollywood polish which I don't normally like I like my indie films to stay indie but I rather enjoyed this film I think Dennis and Demi were fantastic in their roles Sue well she didn't have that much dialogue and she kinda felt she was only there for the obvious reason which was to look like a younger hotter version of Demi Moore so job done. Although her chasing Elizabeth down the hallway and goin full on super roid rage was pretty kool.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,1728253840.0,"See I took it to have a different meaning. The meaning I got from this film was society in general values youth and beauty in females much more than age and wisdom. The tv execs, film execs are always looking for the younger more bankable female rather than one who's like you said sacrificed and put in the years only then to be put out to pasture.

Another poster made a brilliant analysis on cosmetic surgery and the substance and again looking to continue to drain that fountain of youth long after its run dry. 

I saw Elizabeth as a self centred, narcissistic individual who's only reason for living was herself and her dreams and when she didn't achieve them she saw the cheat code and grabbed it. But unfortunately the old saying cheaters never prosper came back to haunt her.

The fact that the video and voice kept saying you are one interested me because I thought ironically the substance seemed a lot to me like power it should never be given to people who seek and and those willing to say no would probably have more of the mindset to use the substance properly but maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe the substance is always doomed for failure regardless of who takes it because its hardcoded in most of humanity to be selfish and take more than what's needed especially when it's offered on a platter.

I like your analysis too tho. That's why I love films like this. They can mean so many different things to people and none of them are wrong if thought throught critically enough.

The only dracula based film I've seen in the past couple of years that was good was Voyage of the Demeter. I really enjoyed that. I'll definitely put Nosferatu on the list. My most anticipated horrors of the year have got to be this Substance and Longlegs.

I keep hoping they make one final scream film and bring Matthew back to play Stu as the killer to tie everything up they could even call it final scream I'm not a scriptwriter but I came up with a pretty good idea for how they could do it even in the last film they show the tv and kirby says yeah his body was never found and he's the only killer who was never definitively shown as dead so they've left the breadcrumbs to do it. All it needs is a good story and someone to pull the trigger.

I was always that kid. If u told me to do something, I'd do the complete opposite üòÜ ü§£ and I'm 40 now, and I haven't changed and don't plan on starting yet. I do believe as a society we are all far too obsessed with beauty and pretty people when in actuality some of the most attractive people I've met have turned out to be some of the most boring people I ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Whether there's a correlation between highly attractive people say not having to work as hard as the rest of us I dunno but it's a sound theory. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that every attractive person has the personality of a goldfish but some of the most amazing people I've ever met certainly weren't 8's or 9's in the beauty department lol üòÜ 

It's kinda like the analogy of rich people never having to have worked for anything and always being given everything so easily. Imo the struggle is what builds character and manners too I might add again some of the wealthiest people I've met have turned out to be rude and obnoxious where as people from poorer backgrounds who have had to scratch and claw for everything they've earned have turned out to be some of the nicest, kindest most caring and interesting people I've come across.

My favourite 2 parts are where >!firstly, she takes the peyote and beer can and patches herself back up. Yeah, it's a bit far-fetched surviving the fall, etc, but looking for a deeper meaning I took the cave to represent possibly that she hadn't survived and that was her descent into the inferno especially with the fire etc. But then waking up with the brand, the fact that her flesh now belonged to the devil, maybe I dunno its fun to ponder these things. Secondly, I like the scene where there both messed up at the end blood everywhere. Visibly against the tiles and floor, it's striking, but I don't know if when he slips if that was intentional, but it looked pretty real and glad they kept it in. I love what he does with the cling film or saran wrap for our us cousin's. Digging into that scene and how it plays out I interpreted it as she had to struggle so now it's his turn so that's why she takes her time with him and let's the fear build in him until its her time to strike and exact her Vengeance making her Revenge complete.

The nudity was excessive, and despite being directed by a woman, the amounts of unnecesarry boobs felt like it was made by a horny man with zero creativity. Somehow it felt slow paced to me, even when they bombarded you with loud sounds and trippy scenes.

It almost made me feel like they thought the audience was too stupid to get the message so they had to cut to little flashbacks showing stuff (like the doctor's scar) or people repeating stuff for you to make the connection.

Thoughts on The Substance?,1727460081.0,1730522162.0,"But I didn‚Äôt. How do you NOT think this movie is hammering home the message as in beating you over the head with it? With a scalpel it‚Äôs done smoothly but a jackhammer is extreme/ over the top and beating you to death. Which is what the director/writer/creators of this movie has done to the audience. 

It‚Äôs like okay we get it.

How many times do you have to have those two guys trying to cast ‚Äúthe new Elisabeth Sparkle‚Äù say ‚Äútoo bad her boobs arent in the middle of her face instead of that nose.‚Äù And ‚ÄúLOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING SURE IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THIS TIME.‚Äù


I just rewatched the movie and those lines from that scene is said a total of 3 or 4 times. We hear Harvey say pretty girls should smile 2-3 times.

Hey did the audience get it the first time? I don‚Äôt think they did hold on let‚Äôs remind them again with a flashback. Wait wait put the PRETTY GIRLS SHOULD SMILE Harvey line at the end where we see Monstro Elisasue on stage.

‚Ä¶wait did the audience get it? Maybe they didn‚Äôt wait let‚Äôs do this next scene where people at the New Year‚Äôs Eve show stand up yelling freak! Monster! 


The bouquet of roses in the beginning ‚Äúthank you for all these years! You were amazing!‚Äù Then the camera focusing in on a closeup of ‚Äúyou WERE amazing‚Äù. Yes we get it she WAS in the past we get what you‚Äôre doing here.

Oh but let‚Äôs add Sue getting a bouquet of roses too ‚Äúbreak a leg! They ARE going to love you‚Äù okay okay now do a close up of the ARE going to love you.

Yes yes we get it. We got it the first time around with Elisabeth Sparkle. Out with the OLD in with the new (and younger).

How you can sit there and tell me in all seriousness that the director didn‚Äôt use a jackhammer to pummel the audience is ridiculous. I gave you concrete specific answers listed above wjth how they beat the audience to death with their intended message.

And how you think that persons quote is weird is just a big sigh. But like I‚Äôve tried to explain the difference between a scalpel and jackhammer and how it‚Äôs an analogy to the directors technique well.. that‚Äôs all I can do - try to explain by defining what the quote meant, how it makes sense, and how the filmmaking here is redundant and ridiculous to the point of making the audience bored vs intrigued.",2

Anyway, I took the wife, who hates anything gory btw, I cant her to watch any horrors or action movies with gore... Anyway, I was lost for words how entertaining this movie was. It was off the charts haha.

Story line is a bit mehhh but the movie content is just incredible. And its one of those movies that makes you really think about the perspectives of the writes of the movie plot/scenes.

I honestly think this movie is a proper art piece! 10/10

**SPOILER ALERT........... STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT YET..............**

My take on it is that she was hating herself getting older, she was then fired from her job and was to be replaced with someone younger and more beautiful making her hate herself even more.

Wishing she could be a younger version of herself again consumed her and took over her thoughts and then she was involved in the accident.

The accident put her in a state between life and death or she was in a coma.... Her thoughts was the plot of the remainder of the movie where they became uglier and uglier resulting in the monster at the end.

Ultimately this movie was a subjective art piece aimed at women who cant handle losing their youth and young beauty and do whatever they can to retain it, in some cases turning into a monster after many rounds of surgeries or injections or whatever.

The man on the other end of the phone tells her many times she can stop and be her current self at any time with no further damage. But she's so hooked on youth that she keeps going which ultimately destroys her. The same way which people addicted to face lifts and other plastic surgeries ruin themselves.",1

Spoilers: It was entertaining, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I was in love with it. It felt like Demi‚Äôs character went from being ambivalent toward the product to being completely gung ho immediately. Then she‚Äôs almost unfazed by how insane the process is, and continues on even when she clearly despises her younger half and is super concerned about what it‚Äôs doing to her body. Her motivations to continue forward evaporated well before her younger half was terminated.

All of it just made her unbelievable as a character even in the face of how much her aging was causing her career to crumble. Then to have her attend the entire event when she felt it unacceptable to go on with a missing tooth but is fine attending as a complete monster was just like wtf is going on.

The filter could have been good if they just used it *half the time*, which will make sense if you watch it.

It was entertaining throughout but kinda weirdly flops between serious body horror and social commentary to straight up comedic absurd action shots.

I‚Äôve seen some people critique the last act after Monstro Elisue looks in the mirror as ‚Äòunnecessary‚Äô but I feel it is what makes the film special and arguably a ‚Äòmasterclass‚Äô. As Monstro Elisue, Elisabeth finally embraces her appearance fully, and heads back to the NYE taping and enters the stage with a finally unrestrained glee, only to be ridiculed and attacked by the crowd, who represent society and also us, the literal audience, and our infatuation with impossible beauty standards. After an entire movie of trying to become beautiful again, she is finally content with herself, despite the crowd‚Äôs horror, and she thwarts the audience and their visceral reaction to her appearance by dousing them in absolutely insane amounts of explosive blood and gore, bathing them in it, before she finally settles onto her star on the walk of fame with a smile on her face.

The most brilliant aspects to me were this: she forced the viewer to see things from the aspect of the typical ‚Äúmale gaze,‚Äù and to spice it up a bit it was interjected with close ups of Dennis Quaids mouth eating shrimp.

Demi Moore to Be Honored in France Ahead of 'The Substance's' Premiere,1730686109.0,1730736946.0,"I think the end really tied together the whole ""YOU ARE ONE"" aspect. Until that I thought that Sue wasn't actually Elisabeth, like they didn't share the same soul so to speak, and that she was essentially a clone. I thought that had to be the case when Sue was able to wake up and exist alongside her before killing her. Then Monstro Elisasue happens and you see that they are now literally ""one"" physically, but they put on the Elisabeth mask and apply lipstick like Elisabeth had earlier, which seemed weird at first because Sue just killed her, why would she opt to look like Elisabeth instead of herself? It just me wonder what actually went down and if it was really all just a metaphor about that part of her ""winning"" and taking over. I'll need to rewatch but I think that's an interesting interpretation, especially considering how it all went down right after she decided to not go through with the termination. Honestly as I write this I could genuinely see everything after that being somewhat of a dream sequence or metaphor or something. The way you're describing it as over the top gore is true but that might just be the whole point, I mean they're filming a new years special with kids watching where all the dancers have their tits out, and the people standing up and screaming is just comical. And don't get me started on all the blood and how people are trying to assault her and everyone's acting like it's the end of the world or something. Oh yeah and of course you can't forget that everyone watched her walk in like that and were completely oblivious. I don't think that's what actually happened. I think that's just how it felt to her. She thought she looked hideous and bombed on the show in front of everyone, and the boos of the audience felt like an assault. That would also make the dancers having their tits out make sense, because to Elisasue that's why they're there, and why she was ever an entertainer herself.

The Abject explores things that disturb our sense of boundaries, identity, and order, like blood, decay, or anything that makes us confront things we usually avoid. It unsettles us because it challenges what we see as normal or ""clean"" boundaries between self and other, alive and dead, whole and broken.

The serum constantly distorts her physical boundaries and identity by making Demi's character Elisabeth create, sustain, and live alongside another version of herself, Sue.

I'm gonna get downvoted for this, cause apparently everyone online loves this movie - but how?   
This is the most predictable movie (until the last 10%) I've seen in years. Really, from a single line you could see exactly how the plot would go.   >!Liz is fired from her job? Oh, let me guess who will take it and be extremely popular. Substance can be misused? Gee, I wonder what would happen! It's been so obvious Sue would misuse the substance, cause she'd want more, and Liz would suffer from it, at first not **that** much (the finger), but then things would escalate to an extreme degree.!< I don't mean to sound like a douche, but I'm genuinely asking - what is creative here in your opinion? What part in the plot surprised you except for maybe the ending?       
The ending, IDK, maybe is creative, but it borderlines on autoparody (>!""I'm not a monster! It's still me!""!< are you fucking serious, this got golden palm for the script?)   
Not to mention the plot holes, like Sue having master engineering skills (the building part) for no reason whatsoever...   
   
But predictability is not the biggest concern of the movie. It's how the director thinks all her viewers are idiots and is extremely unsubtle with her message (which is kinda obvious, to begin with). Did we really need to have it shown on multiple people that Liz and Sue are treated differently, cause one is old, and the other is young and beautiful? Yeah, I got the message the first time.   
Also, whenever >!the substance is misused, you're getting reminded of the instruction of how not to use it, which was like 3 sentences long!<, but they were scared the viewers would have forgotten it already.",2

Don't get me wrong, $45 million is pretty good for its niche, and I'm glad it's successful despite its niche. But a lot of the big mainstream films made something like 10x that amount.

Demi Moore to Be Honored in France Ahead of 'The Substance's' Premiere,1730686109.0,1730712379.0,"I think you‚Äôre confusing predictability with dramatic irony. The movie lays out the rules VERY CLEARLY for us multiple times, and each time we know in the back of our heads that *of course* those rules are going to be broken. The movie knows that we know that. Our basic human sympathy that leads us to not want to see horrific shit happen to a good person creates a sense of impending dread. It‚Äôs a tale of self-destruction through the lens of societal expectations. 

For me, the real surprise of the movie was the contradictory nature of what we were told was meant to be happening vs what was actually happening vis-a-vis the substance itself. One of the FREQUENTLY REPEATED lines is REMEMBER: YOU ARE ONE. But‚Ä¶ it feels very clear from early on that Elizabeth and Sue are *not* the same person. It really doesn‚Äôt seem like Elizabeth is piloting Sue. To me, that‚Äôs a narrative surprise. That‚Äôs artful intention. 

I think that THE SUBSTANCE is a movie that is very loud and obvious on purpose (it‚Äôs a dark comedy after all, and the obviousness is part of its sense of humor) but also has the ability to say things quietly and with nuance at the same time. 

Also Sue being able to build a secret room is not a plot hole. The movie is, once again, a comedy. The fact that she‚Äôs wearing the same hot girl booty shorts that she always does but just puts on some safety glasses for that scene is, in my opinion, fucking hilarious.",15

The hidden room part might have been comedic, I guess the joke didn't work for me. But you'd be surprised how lots of people who actually liked the movie, also didn't get it, and were just listing the reasons why it's possible etc.   
As for the second paragraph, it creates potential plot holes as well. Liz and Sue clearly have different memories (starting from the moment that Sue was created). If so, how did the old doctor know about Liz since it was his younger version that gave her the substance?   
But this could be explained - The old doctor was just stalking people who went there, once he noticed a new number in the locker pop up. The thing is, with how much the movie likes to explain literally everything (once again, reminding the viewer about substance usage, literally everytime Liz/Sue mess it up) I honestly think the writer just didn't this through lol

The product itself ate away at her. She did have an opportunity to stop it, but even that first revelation was too late. She was already exploited. 

Yeah she did it to herself but from the first scene of the movie she was objectified and made lesser. 

I don't think the point of the movie was that she was in the wrong lol

She contributed, because self-harm always requires one's own contribution, but it was still ultimately a symbiotic relationship soured by the one with power. She did not have the power in the relationship, and I think that can be said from multiple perspectives. 

She didn't have power between her/Sue (and wasn't aware of the power she did have until too late) and the power her industry + that abstract corporation has over her was shown throughout the movie as well. They decided every aspect of her life and also knew they had power over her self-worth, which she eventually found far too late. 

Sure she did it to herself through her lifestyle, but it was a symbiotic relationship with the other side sucking the life from her all the way until the end.

Demi Moore to Be Honored in France Ahead of 'The Substance's' Premiere,1730686109.0,1730766101.0,Liz and Sue don't have different memories -- the movie constantly reiterates the fact the they are the same person. It makes sense if you think about the substance as a metaphor for addiction. The way a alcoholic views the things they did while drunk a different person from the sober version of themselves is (I believe) how the movie handles Elisabeth and Sue's relationship. Elisabeth/Sue's inability to understand this is what causes the problems that they have.,1

It was all her choice, and she did it to herself.

Her mindset was already too late before the movie started, and she was sent spiraling in the first bathroom scene. 

Hence, love yourself before it's too late. 

But again, i don't think the point is that she did it to herself. There are contributing external factors in the movie that make it worse for her. They wouldn't be there if the entire point of the movie was this woman did this all to herself.",5

They referred to her as flawless, twice. What does that imply?

Ignoring the whole irony of ""this is the idolized version of Demi Moore and the body standards are so impossible to actually meet we literally had to give her fake breasts""

I'm not sure what exactly you think I'm projecting out. Where have I claimed I don't love others' differences, or am envious of them? I'm perfectly content in my very male form.

I don't want to pontificate too much about the brilliant things this movie did, but one thing I will mention is the way it sets up the jokes visually. Within a scene, it very obviously sets up a premise for a joke and you can see where it's going...then escalates it to an absurd degree, beyond what you even imagined.


As a particular example, I'm thinking of the scene >! in the studio bathroom where Sue gets the idea to use the activator!< which culminates in >! the title card introduction of Monstra Elisasue!<


It gave me similar vibes to Everything, Everywhere All at Once with how frenetic and fast-paced it was and how much it relied on physical comedy.",198

It says so much about how older women are treated, how people are treated based off how they look (particularly the climax, which has multiple layers), insecurity, mental health.

i just wish she gone out with fred...and i wished she terminated it much much earlier and tbh i got so angry about sue for treating her this way when she depends on her - like how could she be so dumb and mess it up this badly ??, but i know its just a metaphor for self hatred and body dysmorphia. the movie was really good, but i kinda wish i didnt watch it because it definitley spoke to that disordered part of me and it was like my biggest fear. even the disfigurment, that out of control thing there, its just so scary",4

Could having to hide your aged body and literally stab yourself with a needle not provoke a bit of oddness?

Edit: I do want to say that I loved the messaging, and loved it for its unique screenplay - I am a massive horror fan but body horror is my least favorite horror. I can generally handle gore but teeth, fingernails and eyeballs are my big ""I cannot"" and the film hit all three. 

Perhaps the grossest body horror film since Dead Alive.",111

To your question, it‚Äôs a very easy-ish/linear plot to follow even if you self-censor the bonkers bits, but this movie WANTS to make you cringe.

More than a straight horror, thriller or even creature feature Substance is aiming and FULLY hits the BODY horror spooky-ookies bullseye.

TL:DR- like a legit rollercoaster you can close your eyes and enjoy the ride but just like any good rollercoaster if you open your eyes at the scariest bits  you‚Äôll be treated to incredible madness that will make surviving the experience all the more fun and exciting in retrospect.",14

I closed my eyes/covered my face for 25-30% of the movie and I have no regrets. I saw it in the theater. If you think you have a tolerance level where that would work, you could watch it at home later. I think it depends on your level, re: gore. The film gives you pretty fair warning when something grotesque is coming, for the most part (there were a few specifically harrowing scenes where you knew what was coming and I just covered my face for like... a full minute. Because NOPE). THAT said: the sound design is, uh, very good so if it's not just visual for you, yeah skip. 

For me, I'm glad I saw it because I really liked the story/writing/themes and performances. There's SO much rich material in it and things to talk about. I also found it really sad, and kind of beautiful in a weird way? I cried at one bit, which is not something I do w/ horror.",8

I would argue, if anything, like countless horrors before, it is using *aging* as the horror element. You know, old people creepy and scary? However, given the theme of the film, it doesn‚Äôt seem mean spirited or even like a trope. My interpretation is that, in our youth we fear and resent aging, but as we age we fear the youth overshadowing us, we fear being forgotten and dismissed since we‚Äôve lost our ‚Äúlight‚Äù and youthful appearance. This film is pretty in your face about those two selves sharing the same ‚Äúbeing‚Äù and fighting for control. It‚Äôs not very subtle about ‚Äúaging actress finds way to turn back the clock‚Äù - >! long story short they are one and can *not* be separated !< - what you‚Äôre seeing is not some reference to burn victims but a freakin lovecraftian nightmare of melded flesh. >!

You can tell the kind of movies that are going to sweep awards before they‚Äôre even released. Take one look at Anora and tell me that isn‚Äôt going to take home at least one or two Oscar‚Äôs.

I am one of a seeming minority who actually liked 'Drive Away Dolls' purely because Qualley has that charisma and energy that is infectious. 

Honestly going into it I didnt really know much at all despite seeing the trailers (that did not reveal much). You are on the right lines but as the film hasnt come out yet/only just came out in many places I dont want to spoil anything. I think it is a very good surprise how Demi Moore (also fantastic here) and Margaret Qualley come to be. 

I will say the story is fairly easy to follow so it should be easy enough to understand what is happening and the stakes at play/the rules they introduce.",14

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,1726202237.0,"I would say that right near the start of the film it certainly is on the nose and heavy handed towards setting the scene for you with the script especially. I would say too that it begins what I call 'artsy' in its cinematography.

But as the story progresses the artsyness gradually declines in line with how the story ramps up and so by the end there is little of that artsyness left replaced by what I would describe as insanity. 

The story is fairly easy to follow and due to the nature of it I appreciated that. Despite that, I would not say that it is consistently heavy handed or on the nose about its dialogue or message after Qualley is introduced especially. I think that the pacing is so spot on and the visual engagement of it (for me at least) completely distracted from feeling any themes they were trying to push were being pushed too hard, although it is very clear what they are going for.",5

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,1726258382.0,"I am glad you brought that up and I think we‚Äôve all needed to have a genuine discussion about things besides moving around it, to preface I haven‚Äôt see it but going off what I‚Äôve read here and in general (no spoilers, I don‚Äôt know anything that happens.)

Whenever I see him or Voight in a movie now, my first instinct is to think what‚Äôs the general reason for it. They both are open with their conservative beliefs and they were in a political movie this year, all the while this movie does come across as progressive and feminist. And AFAIK from brief reading, Quaid is the only one from the cast that‚Äôs really been outspoken about politics here‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ why him? Since he is controversial, and while I can see the point where it does seem he may be playing a bad person, I do still question it.

If it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a good actor, it still feels odd because it can contradict the movies themes in a way. If it‚Äôs because they want to get interest in conservatives watching the movie and maybe present them with progressive ideas I can also see that. Although, I‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt be another movie that doesn‚Äôt really have a stance. I‚Äôve seen a lot of hostility from certain groups being hateful to Erin Moriarty, so it really does make me wonder what exactly is trying to be said, or if there‚Äôs any kind of ulterior message or reinforcement going on.

Requiem for a Dream is one of my top 5 movies of all time, and after typing all this out and with the culture war stuff I do see why they might have casted him, but I don‚Äôt see why auditioned.",2

Pero bueno, desde el inicio de la historia se tomaron bastantes libertades e incoherencias para terminar de contar la historia as√≠ que ya se ve√≠a que no iba a ser algo serio.

 En lo personal, me gust√≥ mucho la pelicula, por lo mismo que ya dije, debo decir que siento rechazo por el genero del terror,  porque normalmente suelen prescindir de hacer buenos personajes o tener una profundidad, m√°s all√° de que de miedo, asco o simplemente sea bizarro.

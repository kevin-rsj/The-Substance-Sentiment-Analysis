Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I'm surprised no one mentioned the generational dismissal of the elderly in this film. I thought the part where Sue puts Elizabeth in the dark room so she could go live her life without the burden of taking care of her in any meaningful way was a great subtext for how we treat our elders by putting them in retirement homes and just forgetting about them. (At least in the US).


Also, along with the thread on beauty and Hollywood, I distinctly saw the loss of her youth at having given Sue life as a parallel to cultural beauty standards overall. A woman at 60 may despise how she looks in comparison to the younger beauties on the screen and in print, but the more time spent making the comparison, the more time and beauty are lost.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"At first I thought the excessive 20-minute climax tarnished a near-perfect film. Then it hit me: it doesn’t stick the landing because it’s not supposed to. Fargeat‘s campy bastardization of the preceding two hours mirrors her protagonist’s own inability to know when to stop. Has a movie ever gone this deliberately off the rails to more effectively underscore the very themes it aims to explore? It heightens its brilliance beyond what I could fully appreciate in the moment.

It’s no surprise Universal backed away from something as subversive as The Substance, so god bless Mubi for taking it wide. Catch it with the loudest, rowdiest crowd you can find—it’s a film that thrives on the collective energy of a fully-immersed audience.",728

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I found myself really relating to the addiction aspect of this movie. Sue is this better, happier, sexier version of Elisabeth while she’s on this “drug”. Everything is a breeze, everyone loves her and she loves herself. While Elisabeth initially agrees to respect the rules, this better version of herself is constantly pushing the boundaries because, at least at first, Sue doesn’t see the consequences for Elisabeth, the ‘sober’ version of herself. It isn’t until she wakes up as Elisabeth again that she realizes what she’s actually done to herself, and she can not wait until the week is up to do it again. When it’s time to switch from Sue to Elisabeth the next time, she pushes it. “What’s the worst that could happen?” “I’m sure it’ll be fine”. Now Elisabeth has to face the even scarier consequences of her actions, and she’s pissed. She’s started to separate ‘sober’ and ‘high’ her, and they resent each other. Sue hates Elisabeth for her lazy, slobbish, sad behavior. It’s everything she hates about herself. Elisabeth hates Sue because she’s actively sucking her life away, yet is the only joy she can feel anymore. But she still can’t stop. She allows it to consume her entirely, and by the end is left completely broken and devastated. Way worse for wear. Wishing she could just go back to normal, but unable to escape.",217

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Can someone help me out - was this supposed to be hilarious, or am I just demented (or both)? I had a blast, I personally felt like it was a very dark comedy that obviously uses excessiveness and absurdity to its benefit to supplement the social commentary. This was the most fun I had in a theater all year, actually was nearly in tears laughing, but don't mistake that for a critique of this film - it's an appraisal. It had to be intentional, all the little things like suddenly introducing out of nowhere subtitles while the monster is speaking at the end - the totally over the top name for the creature in the third title card - and the fact that many characters are just straight up caricatures. It screamed to me dark comedy, but I don't think a lot of people will experience it that way. 

The biggest thing I could do without was the constant cutting back to things to bash you over the head with ""Hey, remember this? This is important!"" That came off as a bit corny to me and it happened several times, I think it would've benefited slightly more by respecting the audience and expecting them to remember obvious threads.

However, my favorite scene of her acting was when she was aggressively rubbing the make up off and messing up her hair. It's such a real, raw scene. No special effects or prosthetics, just pure acting of a woman who feels worthless of what society tells her just because she 60 years old. Margaret Qualley is also equally impressive in this. The scene where Sue was revive had the audience in my theater gasping of “oh shit!”. I love the gory body scenes. I also especially love the dreamlike, surreal comedic campy thriller vibes the film has too. The editing, directing, prosthetics, and screenplay are so great. I get why it won screenplay at Cannes.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

- Dropping the title card in the middle of the instruction video is genius! 
- Coralie Fargeat's directing is exceptional. I couldn't look away even disgusting things are happening on the screen. 
- The first act is slow paced but once the split happens, the movie gets crazy.
- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me. The car crash with no injuries, the chase in the house (reminded me of Coralie's previous movie, Revenge), Sue having great strength, the monster putting on earrings, and the endless blood spray.

The acting from Moore is superb, what a perfect cast for the role both as an actress and as a real life parody. She nailed it! I truly hope she wins some awards for this.

Qualley was fantastic too! And my goodness what a smoke show. Totally fit the 'perfect' other self. Guess I have a new crush! 

Genuine moments of sadness and empathy for Moore's character, wonderful storytelling. Was cracking up when she turned into the 'witch'.

Amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects! As plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie! Shout-out to Quaid as well!

Ending scene was nuts! Reminded me a little of the shock at the end of 'Ready or Not' (another fav of mine), which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of Kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding.

The scene where Demi Moore can’t go out on her date with Fred because of her constant obsession over her appearance was very sad. 

The technical elements are great too. They are pretty similar to Fargeat’s first film Revenge (2017), in terms of the way it is shot, edited, and scored. So if you enjoyed the vibe of that film, you will love this one. I believe The Substance is an improvement in every way over that film. Excited to see what she does next.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"My favorite scene was after cooking all the food/mocking Sue’s interview. Elisabeth is in the bathroom smacking and repeating to herself “you have to stop, you have to-” and it cuts to Sue screaming “CONTROL YOURSELF!” And it pans out to all the mess and disgusting food all over. I loved this movie!",47
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,Shocked there’s no comments here about the AMAZING audio. The music and sfx were so bassy and uncomfortable and perfect!,45
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,It’s funny. And gross. And keeps getting weirder and weirder and weirder. ,38
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"On one hand I couldn't help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death. Desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things don't go as planned etc etc. I remember the Facelift episode of American Horror Story and one of the episodes of Guillermo Del Toro's horror anthology having a similar bit.

But I think The Substance really killed it and made something that still felt totally unique.

The body horror was relentless and I love how they tease the feeling of dread and disgust with the constant closeups. For me one of the grossest parts was Sue getting greedy and draining Elizabeth for more and more fluid as the site got more and more infected. Then finally all that comes out is some bloody pus. I felt like I spent the entire second half of the movie with my hand over my face cringing.

It was great portraying self-hatred through literally two different versions of yourself in conflict and the inevitable climax of trying to destroy yourself. One thing I didn't like about that final fight scene was how absolutely fragile Elizabeth had become in an earlier scene, struggling to stand without breaking her knee. Now she's 100 times more decrepit and taking hits like a boxer and still standing up. I think she should have died a lot earlier to keep things from getting comical but then the vicious beating could have ensued long after to really drive home the point of psychotic self-hatred.

Seeing her reflection in the doorknob was a fantastic and sad moment. Bringing everything back to the beaten up hollywood star was a cool touch.

When the final monstro form crumbled to pieces and all that was left was her face poking out I ALMOST thought her whole normal body was going to emerge unscathed and then she'd get a banal call from the company saying the experience was complete. ""Thanks for choosing us!"" But I guess that would have been a bit too goofy for no reason.",37
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"This might be ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THIS YEAR. Holy shit, Quaid (lol ""Harvey"" I seen what you did there) stole the scene every time he was on camera, Qualley really was out to be *that* alpha bitch, Moore's self loathing doubt and her losing it after the first half of the film made me laugh ruefully for her.

The plot is makes it clear that Sue was going to sabotage Elizabeth (I thought Elisabeth was gonna get revenge given the chicken in the navel bit by way of overeating then causing her to sprout food from herself...?) but I loved it's unpredictability and descent into utter chaos at the end. The ostensible cliche phrase ""take care of yourself"" had so much weight to it, plus I love the commentary on how showbiz will chew one up and spit you out especially if you're eye candy (dear lord so many butt shots, I'm assuming commentary on the male gaze?), and also body dysmorphia and the lengths one would go for self preservation. Speaking of eye candy the chaotic cinematography is chef's kiss, I loved also when Harvey was around he would speak to the camera whether it be Sue or Elisabeth.

The end of the film with Monstro Elisasue gave me so many mixed feelings of dark humor laughter at how unhinged it was, sadness out of a fading star, and shock at the horrifying amalgamation of body parts. You couldn't help feel sorry for the Elisabeth slime's last chance at happiness as she slowly fades at her Hall of Fame star (that foreshadowing at the beginning with the burger)

The only negatives I have are nitpicks: One the slow pacing until the middle of the film, two (suspension of disbelief be damned) how in gods name did Sue become an interior designer overnight?

TL;DR The social commentary, the chaos and unpredictability, great acting, and utterly over the top presentation for the film, make it one of my favorite films of the year so far!

9/10, don't pull chicken from your navel and while I think there was social commentary to be said, Qualley's got a nice ass

  
Edit: Way off topic and a spoiler for the film Kinds of Kindness which also had Qualley >!She just can't get away from her unconscious body being dragged, huh...?!<",73

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"The movie was totally a modern fairy tale. People calling it a satire, but it has little to offer on that front. When taken as a fantastical tale on how one's vanity and self-absorption (note the recurring image of the giant photo of herself Elizabeth had put on her apartment's wall) can lead to one's doom, it works much better. 

If the movie was meant to be this scathing satire of the industry, then why show the protagonist flouting the instructions due to her own whims rather than industry's pressure? Like the first time she goes over the limit is so that she can fuck a random douchebag she's brought home, lol. (in fact, both the guys she's shown sleeping with are these dumb beefcakes; doesn't seem like her mindset was particularly different from that of the sleazy exec) Meanwhile the exec is perfectly willing to accommodate her ""week on, week off"" schedule. It almost felt like the movie went out of its way to place more blame on her than on ""society"". It even offered her an alternative in the form of the adoring fan trying to ask her older self out, only for her to be unable to cope with the fact she's not as beautiful as her younger self. Again, here's a guy who (apparently) doesn't care, but because SHE cared on a such fundamental level, she was paralyzed from taking the opportunity. She's not a sympathetic character and she fell victim primarily to her own vices.",291

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"This was my biggest takeaway from the movie.

I can make peace with being awkward and ugly. I am who I am and all we can do is work towards the best version of ourselves. And the people we need to keep around in our lives are the people that don’t really pay mind to the superficial stuff.

It was like a dark horror comedy at the end but beneath it all I ended up just feeling deeply sad for women that feel they have to keep up a certain way because of societal expectations",368
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Absolutely!  For a movie with so much nudity with stunningly gorgeous women, I felt on top of the world strutting around afterwards.

Close-ups are such an effective framing device when used well and I feel it is becoming a lost art, but this movie really was a masterclass on how to do it.",1157

 We gave him some water and all he said was ""The teeth falling out, Jesus, I can't"" and stumbled off.

My headcanon is that some legitimate medical corporation is developing this but beta-testing on the black market. 

Another take - the doctor who recommends it to her. How would he know when her refill time was? Pay even closer attention - the number on the line sounds like his Other Self. Do you think the doctor developed the substance and wants to inflict his suffering to others? He wasn’t exactly happy in the diner. 

I love how self contained yet expansive this film’s world is!",330

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"The way I interpreted it was that in the beginning Elizabeth was fully living through Sue and feeling the adoration. However as the experiment went along, Sue became more autonomous and let the glamorous life dictate her personality and thus became her own person. To the point where Elisabeth living through Sue was like a alcohol/drug binge haze; she may not remember exactly what happened but she still remembers the overall feeling of being beautiful and accepted.  When she wakes up and sees the mess Sue makes, its just one big hang over. It sort of like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

  
I only saw it yesterday so I may be missing something but that was my interpretation.",314
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"My take on it was Sue was like being high, and Elizabeth was the comedown",68
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,I think they didn't share the consciousness. Elisabeth was clearly shocked to see the state of the apartment,30
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I saw it as a bit like waking up hungover and slowly remembering all the things you did while you were hammered last night.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,Yeah I feel like the lack of subtlety was one of the main points of the movie. The side characters are purposefully caricatures—it's obviously textual storytelling rather than literalism and that works in its favor.,504
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"While I love that joke, I don't think it is the criticism that people often seem to think it is. Bluntness on its own can also be an effective narrative style.",118

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"> my favorite scene of her acting was when she was aggressively rubbing the make up off and messing up her hair 

I would also like to point out the phone call she makes that leads into that scene. She’s got this innocent sort of schoolyard crush going on when she’s setting up the date with Fred, showing a real levity and ease we haven’t seen her experience yet. It really helps set up the visceral self-hatred that follows. A truly fantastic performance all around.",264
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"For how utterly grotesque and bonkers the film gets, that date prep scene is uncomfortably real a d all the better for it.

Elisabeth driving herself mad trying to be absolutely perfect but it’s never enough because she’s constantly comparing herself to the sparkly billboard of Sue, comparing herself to herself, and refusing to let herself be happy is painful and heartbreaking to watch",131
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I laughed out loud when she left her apartment as the old Gollum, and shouted “FUCK OFF!” to the weird neighbour.",61

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Here me out, I absolutely loved The Substance's ending-- specifically the climax. That entire film, Elizabeth is a victim- she's a victim from her producer, the industry at large, and even herself. I adored the bloody theatre scene because everyone was suffering. Yes, still including Sue, but also the fellow performers, the slimy executive, and even the audience. Instead of an uplifting ending, everyone has instead been dragged down. It was pyrrhic victory, scorched earth, and it was really the closest thing that a movie like this could have to a ""happy"" ending.",42
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,I knew she was good when I watched her in Maid,51
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,its also very apparent with the picture of dorian gray references throughout the movie. Her having a giant picture of herself in her apartment where she lives not only shows the vanity but also represented how lonely she felt in her life at her age. She was only had someone living with her in the apartment was the boyfriend she had for three months as Sue. I felt bad for her that she had to told him to get out and he became afraid of her.,60
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"In regards to the chicken from the navel:

Sue was just a piece of meat and it's all she really aspired to be. elizabeth couldnt stop eating and leaving completely empty chicken carcasses around and sue fucking hated that. Sue mostly hated it because it's gross behavior but it's deeper in that elizabeth was a carcass that used to have meat on it but had already been picked clean. Her time had passed, which is also what sue hated. i saw it a few days ago but iirc after the chicken bone navel scene sue get a lot angrier at elizabeth. Kind of reminded that what she has as sue won't last forever either. Being a consumed remnant always on her mind.

Grosses me out to he referring to women like this but the symbolism is there",63

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I was still a bit confused at that part bc I just thought that Elizabeth must've had other people do that type of work for her during her prime.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Yes! Like the billboard for her New Year’s Show changed from “tomorrow” to “tonight.” It was grounded in reality, and made references to Hollywood, but it wasn’t Hollywood.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,Well said! It does place most of the onus squarely on Elizabeth but it just shows how deeply internalized misogyny can become. It’s a career’s worth of little slights like “you ‘were’ great” and “at 50 it just stops” that got under her skin and turned into self hatred.,71
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"so whenever I watch Park Chan-Wook films I get the feeling of like a dark twisted fairy tale. I was definitely getting those same vibes watching The Substance. Nothing is overly explained. Everything is to be taken at face value. The characters are almost archetypes more than anything else - I saw a letterboxd review complaining that we didn't get to know more about Elisabeth and her 'relationship with her mother' (LMAO) but i actually like that that was the case. she was just an archetype of an aging star. the beautiful saturated colors, everything being over the top and dramatic, the way the actual logistics of The Substance are not explained at all, the way Sue literally steals life and time from Elisabeth. To me it was all a very dark and twisted fairytale. I saw in an interview the director say she took inspiration from South Korean filmmakers but it was in regards to her previous film Revenge, and she did not say which South Korean filmmakers, but I definitely felt echos of Park Chan-Wook in The Substance",42
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I got Snow White so much. I’ve been going through different threads searching for anyone else who has said Snow White. Especially in the beginning when Elisabeth was wearing a blue dress, a yellow coat, and a red bag. I noted that it’s either primary colors or that it’s Snow White. But later in the film, Elisabeth has moments where she’s hunched over and gives the appearance of the wicked queen when she’s disguise as the witch. & ofc the fact that she’s going insane over the fair maiden.",32

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"This scene made me cry for this reason. At times I've looked in the mirror and have been so upset with how I look, comparing myself to times I looked ""better"" that I wanted to smash my head bloody into the mirror. Seeing Sue do this and feel so much hatred toward her older counterpart broke my heart, poor Elisabeth. After the movie I vowed to never think such horrible things about myself again.",32

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"yes! maybe this was already obvious, but i also saw the self sabotage thing as a metaphor for the ways certain methods of maintaining appearances can literally be harmful to our future selves and aging bodies i.e. dieting, plastic surgery, etc. As someone with a past ED, I starved myself in order to achieve the ""look"" i wanted in that moment, not thinking about the compound effects of that malnourishment as I age. Same goes for people obsessed with fitness or those who get invasive plastic surgery procedures.  it made me feel so sad, but also protective of my past and future selves.",68

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I loved the juxtaposition of him vs the women in general. Like his teeth being so gross and him being *allowed* to have gross teeth. Him being *allowed* to have such disgusting table manners and being *allowed* to have wrinkles, flaws and such a disgusting personality thats messy and human and isn’t 2D - where as sparkle/sue have to be young, bleached, botoxed, smiling, quiet, plucked, polite, sexy and posed at all times ready for consumption without any complaints.  ",47

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"
I get all of that. I’m talking about Demi Moore as an actual person. The common comment we make about her (and I’m just as guilty) is “she looks great for her age!” It’s such a weirdly meta comment that we as a viewer could make about Demi as an older woman in show business playing an older woman in show business who gets fired because she’s too old. It’s so conditioned in our society to exalt youth as the ideal that we can’t just say Demi is beautiful without “for her age.”",109
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Everyone in this movie was absolutely amazing. I love how both actresses illustrate different parts of Elizabeth's personality while being the same person. Elizabeth represents the quiet and sorrowful aspect of her personality that longs for her days as a prominent actress that wasn't facing the end of her career due to sexism and ageism in Hollywood. Whereas Sue represents her extroverted tendencies, and her love of performing (as well as her narcissistic, self-centered, and self-destructive qualities). Seeing the two versions of herself fight for control were absolutely fascinating and it made for some of the most brilliant commentary on addiction as well as how Hollywood places unattainable standards of beauty on aging women. I fully believe it will be a cult classic in years to come.",639
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Top to bottom. I’ve seen it twice now & what blew me away on second watch was the insane facial acting & vocal inflections she made crawling towards the star.

She saw herself as hideous because she's no longer in her early twenties; being around a guy who sees her attractive at 50 probably would've helped her self-esteem a ton.

We don't know much about Fred but he comes across like a bit of a sappy loser and he is THRILLED that Elisabeth actually calls him. By contrast, Elisabeth is only humouring him when he gives her his number and only calls him to boost her own self-esteem.

I didn't think the wider context needed to be shown much to be understood - Harvey was just the catalyst. In Hollywood, it's outside of the norm for a woman not to have 'work done' when they get older. I doubt all of those actresses are \*particularly insecure, just realistic according to what culture 'expects'. Even all the women I know in their 30s are stressing about whether they should get botox, facelifts or fillers, and I don't live anywhere near Hollywood. It's in our culture.

After he gets enough research proving that the process is ""safe"" he probably then plans to present it to the FDA and regulatory bodies to formally legalize it. Despite the fact that the service has technically worked, it's still dangerous as it causes severe psychological problems in both halves of the person it produces and it can still cause severe harm if directions aren't followed to the letter.

People abuse substances to temporarily feel like a better version of themselves, but it always has side effects that slowly eat away at you.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Had some time to digest this (and get to a computer rather than my phone).

I really appreciated this film for so many things (acting, practical effects, editing, score, etc.) but I really think there’s something special about the screenplay and that it really reflects a female POV that is missing from a lot of horror.

First, the real horror is so very internal. Elizabeth’s problem is not so much Hollywood or the way older women are tossed aside, though that’s certainly there, her real problem is the way she views and values herself. She is self destructive because the real problem is internal, it’s the way she views herself. She cannot see what we as viewers can see (and casting Demi Moore here was a stroke of genius) at any age, she is stunning by any societal standard—but that’s not how she sees herself. She sees herself as haggard and a monster, and when the “misuse of the substance” takes a toll on her, that’s the toll it takes. It makes her appear on the outside the way she feels and views herself on the inside. That scene before the date is heartbreaking if you’re a woman because we have all experienced that dysmorphia to some extent—that experience of being unable to really see yourself because of feelings of inadequacy. This really makes this film so different than most others—it’s not about being turning into a monster, it’s about seeing yourself as a monster.

The heartbreaking thing about Sue is that she's not a younger Elizabeth. She's someone else entirely. The best version of you (as a woman) isn't even YOU. It's someone else entirely. You were never good enough. And even the best version of you has insecurities because she's not good enough either.

Second, the narrative structure really emphasizes this. In a lot of screenplays, once Elizabeth unlocked Sue, Sue would have gone on to take down the man--- to get revenge on everyone in Hollywood who mistreated Elizabeth. But that’s not at all where the narrative goes. Because although there are many terrible characters, they really aren’t the antagonist. Elizabeth is both protagonist and antagonist. She is truly her own worst enemy, both in her Sue form but also in her Elizabeth form as she punishes herself by binging and trashing her apartment and destroying everything around herself. This could have very easily strayed into a revenge tale, and I think it’s partially the female POV that sidesteps that narrative to take the story in a different direction. 

Third, I love how the male gaze is used in this film. I think it’s very brave and effective. It’s not shown to be bad. It’s just cranked up to 11, and then 15, and then 200 until you are disgusted by it without being told to feel that way. All the huge close ups of bodies and body parts. Especially at the end, where Monstro Elisasue is just an amalgamation of body parts. It’s so in your face and unabashed. The end is seriously like “You like tits? You want tits? Here’s another one for ya!” It makes things so sexual that they become completely UN sexual. And all the nudity is presented in the most clinical of settings—against a white tiled bathroom. I’ve seen people say that they feel like the film falls into presenting the male gaze and I think that’s missing the point—it’s about letting the audience reject the male gaze in a way Elizabeth never really is able to. It’s wildly effective.

I see why this won a screenplay award at Cannes. It’s not only audacious and original but it has a POV that is largely absent from the genre and really deserves to be represented.

I've watched all the main body horror movies people talk about, and none of them got me like this.



That last 30-45 minutes is just straight up insanity. When the movie ended, I just sat there for a minute, and then I went to the lobby and sat on the bench in complete disbelief, speechless. I loved everything about it. When I saw Margaret Qualley was staring in this, I knew it was gonna be something special. She was sensational, and so was Demi Moore. I don't really know how you top a movie like this. I really believe on all levels it was damn near perfection. Maybe it could've got trimmed down just a little bit but even for a movie that was over 2 hours long, you're so engrossed in everything that's happening on screen that it doesn't even feel like it has been that long.



This might be one of my favorite movies I have ever watched, definitely one of the best horrors and by far the best theater experience. I'll be waiting for another movie to top this theater experience. Hearing the whole crowd groan and make noises and physically react was awesome.

As a woman - I think we’ve all considered how much powerful we could be by contorting to society’s standard of beauty. I took this away as a metaphorical exploration of the ridiculous beauty standards were held to.

The ending really worked for me. I likened it to people who get plastic surgery and are satiated for a while, only to become insecure again, convince themselves they need more, and end up botched and ridiculed.

Sue is so desperate to fix her problem that she forgets she's already a product of Elisabeth's vanity which results in her becoming a literal monster.

The audience turning on her didn't feel all that dissimilar to the comment section of a celebrity photo after some fresh work on their face.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. I went in completely blind (well ok I read about one sentence that said Demi Moore is in it and she takes some drug to be younger and I knew it was a horror film) and only learned about the movie a few days ago.

I was already fully onboard with just the out there sci-fi type premise of birthing a younger self and trading consciousness weekly. That alone can make an interesting movie. Then it goes more and more body horror and it’s just…wow. I loved the over the top absurdity of…I guess the entire movie. But especially the dance scene, Sue just walking around on the street, and even her drinking a Diet Coke. 

And of course, the absolutely bonkers completely insane ending. I’m usually pretty good at guessing the ending especially of horror films having watched so many but I did not see this coming. Not like that. You know something is gonna go wrong but wow.

Demi Moore was stellar. Her best performance? And I didn’t know Dennis Quaid could chew scenery so good. About as good as he chewed them shrimps. 

Like another commenter said, my theater didn’t get up when the lights kicked on. Everyone just kinda sat there in silence for a bit. I hope this film picks up steam because it might be the best theater experience I’ve had with a horror movie or almost any movie in some time. It will be a shame if it doesn’t get the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Though I dunno who I would recommend this to. I feel like the average person would think I’m at best a sex pest by the middle or complete lunatic by the end. 

Question - did they share the same brain/memories at all? I thought not but it makes you think - kinda a raw deal if you don’t get to experience it at all. I suppose that’s the point, the aging movie star watching as a younger version supplants her. But if you don’t get the memories or ability to live through your younger self directly I don’t think many would take the substance. I know they must share something somehow due to the chicken dream though. 

Also I was CACKLING during the climax. And the over the top dance. I think it made a lot of people in my theater uncomfortable (both scenes really) and I and my wife had to be the only people openly laughing out loud. The cut to the child previously so excited sobbing and covered in blood made me laugh even more. I need to watch this again.",38
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it. 


The first 60 minutes are a fantastic drama/scifi adjacent take on womanhood; that alone was gripping. But there were cracks in the glamour. You could feel how defeated Elisabeth was. Demi acted her fucking ass off. 


Then the next 40 minutes manages to tell a gripping story of a woman who so desperately yearns for youth that she creates an entirely new person. Not a younger version of herself mind you, just a completely new person. A *better* person. Sue begins to ascend and realizes how “sad” Elisabeth is and grows disgusted of her, turning her into nothing more than cattle for her to take youth from. 


That alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just Hollywood. Also shout out to Coralie for having a real reason for showing off Sues body; it’s over the top for a reason and doesn’t feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror - it has purpose and meaning. 



Then you have the last 30 minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie I’ve ever seen. This is Society meets The Thing meets The Fly wrapped in a Barbie bow. The monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out Elisabeth head taped on. It’s just so ridiculous and absurd and it *works*. I’m sure there’s so many metaphors I’m missing, but I did think that the end where she’s literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period. Maybe that’s off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me. 



This movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, Demi Moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of American culture around women in general. 



I have no notes, nothing needed to be changed. 10/10. Easily one of the best horror movies of the past 20 years, an instant classic.",31
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Absolutely loved it. Thought it was brilliant. It had such a distinct aesthetic. The colors, the costuming, the close-ups. Then that last 20 min. Just amazing.",25

So much to unpack, and I have got to see it in a packed theater. Best body horror since The Fly. Demands rewatches.",26
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I've just come back from watching it and I absolutely fucking loved it. I'm a huge fan of body horror films, and special effects guys like Brian Yuzna. This does not hold back.

The first two acts are relatively sedate and take a while to get going but the sound design is phenomenal. Every act gets a sound which is amped up. Inserting a needle gets a squelch. Eating a shrimp gets a crunchy squelch. Even down to the shoes that Quaid character has have these steel heels so he just stomps down the hallway.

The third act is what's going to have everyone talking though. That's where the training wheels are fully off and it goes absolutely crazy. At one point it looks like everyone is at a GWAR concert with the spraying of blood into the audience.

There is commentary there about how women in this industry are highlighted, used and then spat out but I liked how it didn't preach about it, you could argue its almost quite reserved about it in truth. Small parts like the first time Sue walks down the street people step to the side for her to when Elizabeth does a day later and people are virtually bumping into her.

Demi Moore is phenomenal in this. I don't know if a body double was used at times and I don't think brave is the right word as it sounds almost patronising but she shows a lot. To have a camera pointed at you to show where you've aged and how things get lumpy and bumpy especially when you were known to be absolutely beautiful must have been hard for anyone to do. I wonder if the fact that it was a female director that Moore took this part on. The film works on another level too because the focal point is Moore, and her history of surgery and chasing youth.

I'm so glad to have seen this on a big screen. The only downside was how few people were there. I've read online of people being in packed cinemas where people were dry retching.

- Dropping the title card in the middle of the instruction video is genius! 
- Coralie Fargeat's directing is exceptional. I couldn't look away even disgusting things are happening on the screen. 
- The first act is slow paced but once the split happens, the movie gets crazy.
- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me. The car crash with no injuries, the chase in the house (reminded me of Coralie's previous movie, Revenge), Sue having great strength, the monster putting on earrings, and the endless blood spray.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I have a hot take. The film wants us to feel heartbroken for Elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she can't help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change. The implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards. Judging by people's comments here (""no, honey, you're so beautiful!""), it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way. This troubles me. I think it's really the wrong message from this film. Elizabeth's core mental illness from the start was not her self-loathing; it was her self-obsession. Everything about her life was completely and utterly self-absorbed. (She makes Donald Trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison.) Trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful (or great) they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin. The thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasn't, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful; it was her need for human connection. And no amount of feeling beautiful and self-love would have lead her (and in fact did not lead her) to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be self-absorbed. The deeper moral that this film missed is: Being self-obsessed is unhealthy—a meaningful life comes from caring about others.",16

After the final fight between Sue and Elisabeth the bathroom is absolutely trashed. The mirror is definitely smashed and there is blood everywhere, probably even some broken tiles. But when Sue returns home from the NYE filming to ""re-activate"" the bathroom is pristine again, even the mirror is repaired. So three options here I guess - 1) Sue cleaned and repaired the bathroom before heading to the NYE taping (we've seen she's pretty handy but was there time?) 2) Her returning home to reactivate isn't real, more a fantasy sequence? 3) I'm overthinking this and it's just a continuity error intentionally left in there to service the climax of the film.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Probably the most extreme body horror I’ve ever seen on screen. The practical effects were sensational!

It’s odd because, at two-and-a-half hours long, I felt like they left a lot of possibilities on the table. For example: I thought that Sue might try to seduce her dorky neighbor and harvest his spinal fluid to see if it would stabilize her. And yet, at the same time, I can’t think of anything that I would have cut from the film that we got.

Tactical editing and punctuated sound effects gripped me from the get-go and once the ball gets rolling that sense of curiosity successively builds into a truly satisfying climax. Something so hard to watch yet even harder to avert your attention from. Emotional weight unleashed with no hesitation. Felt like a Lynchian pastiche (super imposed flashbacks, dramatic sow motion, uncanny character acting, Hollywood de-glorification) if it was shot by Kubrick. The film is a bit “blunt” on what it’s trying to communicate. Didnt give me a whole lot to piece together or carefully consider once the credits rolled the way Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway did, but it sacrifices that for a focused sense of immersion.  Overall, I loved it and I’d highly recommend. Fingers crossed this gets a positive reception. Oh and see it in a crowd.",16
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I definitely liked it but I also thought a tighter running time would’ve been better for its relentlessly in-your-face style. Cronenberg told The Fly in 96 minutes.,22
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"First the body horror and sound design was 10/10 for me, def one of the best experiences I’ve had seeing this film in theaters.

But my main gripe is that I don’t understand Elisabeth’s motivations AT ALL. Why did she go through this process when the end result has no benefits for her?

We establish that Elisabeth aligns her self worth with her looks so the logical through-line is that she’s willing to do anything to feel beautiful again, but the substance only makes a younger and better looking clone of her. Elisabeth does not experience anything Sue does, she’s basically in a coma whenever she trades places. So what’s the point?

I could maybe see that she would want to live vicariously through Sue like a parent might do, but Elisabeth resents Sue from the beginning and her presence only makes her feel worse about herself. 

Then I thought maybe she’s willing to do this since she needs money and can’t sustain her way of life since she’s too “old and unattractive” to do her previous job, but the film never makes a note that she’s struggling and even if she was fired from her job I assume she’s made enough over the years to live comfortably. 

Also, why was Elisabeth so distraught when Sue didn’t respect the balance and made Elisabeth age more by not switching in time? Elisabeth didn’t have friends or hobbies and when she was in control she stayed in the house all day. If she was already unhappy with the way she looked, then I’m not sure why becoming uglier would affect her so much.  

I’ve seen this type of idea put on screen before where a woman does something drastic to regain/attain beauty but then it goes wrong and the end result is that she’s worse off than where she started. If the point of this film was just to make a gory film spectacle like Terrifier that’s not meant to be analyzed or hard to think about, then at least make it shorter (the run time was kinda long). It would’ve had the same result and shock value imo. 

Someone please tell me if I’m missing something? I personally think character motivations such as this can’t really be swept under the rug since it’s the catalyst for literally everything that happens in the movie.

Tldr; Elisabeth’s motivations for taking the substance were unclear to me since none of the results seemed to benefit her in any meaningful way.",10

I have to say though, everyone's been calling it the grossest goriest film ever made, and I really didn't think so? *Bloodiest*, probably. But while it certainly had the back opening and the teeth and the knee and all of that, I didn't feel sick like many people have said or feel that it was much different than what I've seen in a lot of horror films. Yes, I went ""eugh"" several times but the kid trying to gouge his own eye in Talk To Me was way worse than this. Not to make it sound like anything negative, I still loved the film, but I'm a bit confused.

Especially during Sue's first shower, the way she feels her new body is not for us, but for her. She is lusting after her new, younger body, and all of the camera angles just drive it home. Pump It Up was a visual love letter to her new body,   
  
I'm not denying the fact that the world they live in is run by a skewed lens where certain bodies are commodities in an extreme way (compared to ours lol), so it would make sense for there to be ""gratuitous"" body shots, but so much of it is how much Sue loves her body and we just get to be along for the ride. 

It forced me to rethink how I viewed those shots, like it was all self-love. My first reaction is always like, ""Okay Michael Bay, we get it, she has boobs"", and don't get me wrong, as a Bisexual Disaster, I'm down for anything, but normally there's no substance behind shots like that (pun not intended).

The acting was great. The body horror was well done. I spent most of the movie supremely impressed, ready to sing this movie’s praises from the hilltops…

…and the last 30 minutes ruined it for me. It was predictable and trite. The plot ceased to make sense. It went from horrific and deeply moving to the worst kind of 2-bit horror comedy. I laughed a great deal, and quietly encouraged the main character to hurl herself from the rooftop. It was…silly.

All I knew was that it is a horror and that it got positive reviews in the kind of more ""alternative"" movie circles I'm into. It was absolutely insane.

I assume because of how sexual and gratuitous that first hour was but it was literally two minutes before things took a turn and got super gross (the only grossness so far was the activation).

But I think, since the film is partly addressing the male dominated film / entertainment industry (the women's washroom in the Kubrick hallway is closed, forcing Elisabeth to use the men's toilets, also decorated like The Shining), I think Fargeat may also be saying:

""Look, as a female film director (especially in horror) these are the tools I've been given to use. All the references I have are from male directors, because women were locked out of the industry, so I'm going to use the tools of this male-dominated art form to say something about the experience of women.""

The commentary on Hollywood/celebrity culture made me realize that ""Hollywood"" as a cultural force is quite literally psychopathic - as much as Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, is. The industry and the culture will support movies like this w/ a critical message of harsh body image standards,  all the while continuing to prance forth creating and reinforcing a culture and community that is barely exaggerated in *The Substance*.

Before that I figured they shared consciousness but the contrast in their appearances and people's reactions to them made Elisabeth adopt a sort of split personality and led to the resulting resentment when Elisabeth bore the consequences of Sue's greediness or Sue's life was interrupted by the need to go back to Elisabeth. 

But then how do we explain the fight?

Because if it's more of a cloning scenario I find it hard to believe Elisabeth would be counting the days to be Sue again since for her it would essentially just be a week-long nap, but again...how did the fight work?

Close ups of her body in the bathroom scenes. Her face looks much younger than her body when she is naked, without perfect lighting, etc.

It makes sense--the director said in an interview that the ending, her face smiling because it was free from the body that she felt betrayed her.",12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"No, that is the theme of the movie.

But consciousness is also heavily influenced by age, hormones, state of mind etc. Its not a clone, theyre the same person. As Sue she reverts to not only looking younger but also acting younger. Immature, reckless etc 
 
 
 
She resents her younger self for not taking better care of herself (much like many do in real life, except for us our younger self isnt fucking us over every 7 days, they fucked us over 25 years ago)",18
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Sue and Elisabeth are the same person. One consciousnesses taking turns in one body.

Why do people engage in all a manner of self destructive behavior like taking drugs or excessive gambling... because it feels good in the moment. Sue and Elisabeth are the same person. They wanted to be young and beautiful and loved. The moments of being happy seemed worth the moments of being bitterly unhappy. In the end, maybe it wasn't worth it. But it wouldn't be the first time someone chased the promise of being happy even when it was clear there would be costs.

Put another way... take a real like example. Jennifer Grey was succeeding in Hollywood, making money and booking good gig. She got cosmetic surgery thinking it would make her ""better"" and instead it made her so unrecognizable that it derailed her career. Why would any person go through the pain, risk, $$$ etc. for cosmetic surgery. Because they person tells themselves it will be worth it, they will be ""better."" But it's always a lie. You can never reach perfection because it's always off in the distance no matter how fast you run.

People do this every day-- hair implants, extreme diets, cosmetic surgeries, weird beauty treatments, etc.

Elisabeth didn't realize how deep her own self loathing went. She thought she'd be happy in both personas, and that it was enough. Turns out she was wrong.

Of all the character motivations in horror movies, I understand this one the most. Are you telling me you'd turn down the fountain of youth or a chance to be your best self?",6

We should also consider that this film was made BY a woman, which I know that doesn't always make things better (i.e., Slumber Party Massacre's director Amy Jones having to add in a random super-nude scene to placate producer Roger Corman), but this film is all about \*obsessing\* over one's looks - whether in self-loathing or infantilization/wonder. It emphasizes the very real conscious AND unconscious act of body-checking (specifically for women) and how it stems from the obsession with how others perceive us. It's masterful, and I love Coralie Fargeat so damn much! A GENIUS.",5

Oddly enough, that's one of the places I've just recently noticed has lost a lot of youthfulness on me. And the amount of times I've gotten dressed up, put my face on, feel great ... and then had a crisis of confidence when I look in a different mirror in different lighting...it's happened many times. 

What she physically did to herself in that scene is sometimes how my brain is to me about what I look like.",12

At 45 I feel invisible when I go out to a bar now.
I think it’s worse because I used to get a lot of attention when I was younger. 

Getting older is terrifying. It’s like watching a flower wither, dry up and die. 
Society’s view on aging will never change for that reason. No one likes to look at a vase of withered flowers.

The beauty of youth will always be favored and no matter how many face lifts women have, they always look their age - you can’t fight it.",8

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I loved this movie bc it’s making several different commentaries simultaneously. There’s the clear theme of the pressure women feel in our patriarchal society. There’s also just a thread that highlights the inner monologue of an insecure person, and the brutality and self-sabotage we all inflict upon ourselves. We’re our own worst enemy, right?

But the most poignant theme for me is the commentary on addiction. I’ve had struggles with that before, and to me, this was actually the main theme of the movie. The phone pinging with messages like “are you ok?” while Elizabeth sits in darkness was too real. Or when she’s laying in the shower, banging her head on the floor saying “stop, stop….” I bet a lot of people know exactly what that feeling is like. I know I do. Glad I’m not there anymore. 

The whole concept of someone recklessly stealing time and physical health from themself is all about addiction to me. The self-hatred, the isolation, and the diminishing returns all ring true. The idea of slowly killing yourself while pretending everything is fine is something most addicts can resonate with. And there’s a couple a serious nods to Requiem for a Dream, especially the infected spine injection scenes….

It’s a brilliant movie. I’ll be thinking about that one for a long time",5

It’s pretty clear Elisabeth has self esteem issues from the jump. Even when her exercise show is going well, it’s a show about taking who you are and changing/improving it. As though it’s just a given that no women can ever be good enough, there’s always something to improve. 

And Elisabeth is Sue... even if she's different looking on the outside. Her insecurites and self-loathing followed her into the Sue persona.

The Substance really just heightens what she was already struggling with. You have to work through issues, you can’t medicate them away or put makeup on them or cut them off with a cosmetic surgery. If there’s something bothering you inside you have to work through it genuinely.",29

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Yeah, if you’ve got a weak stomach, it’s not for you. I don’t, but I still needed a Tums after it was over.",5
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"A standout moment for me was right before Elisabeth began using the substance - when she’s naked in her bathroom. It didn’t feel sexual like I’m used to in movies. It was a real moment, of a woman just looking at herself in her mirror. No undertones of performing for others, just existing.",48
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Movie was hilarious. Things can be both sad and funny at the same time. The curling iron or earring scenes being played up for laughs doesn’t make the movies message any less poignant and I’m glad the director realized that because she clearly made those scenes with the intention for them to be funny.,11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Some men were laughing at Elisabeth when she was trying to get ready for her date, and getting increasingly frustrated at her appearance. Thats just not a moment that was funny to me or probably most other women. I actually felt like crying during that scene, because I think we’ve all been there after a certain point in time.",64
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I gotta be honest, id never heard her and now im blown away. (and ive only clicked through her stuff quickly on YouTUbe, going to dig in more)

this fits in perfectly with my love of stuff like John Zorn and his whole world of musicians",5
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Someone described it as a Gwar concert,4
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Yeah it was heartbreaking to see her unable to stop hating herself and miss one of the few chances she had to be genuinely loved and appreciated by someone.,16
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Looking at the stars while on a star. How on earth did I miss the connection when I watched it at the cinema yesterday? Now I get it : she once tried to shoot for the stars in the sky and literally ended up even further away- instead of a woman standing, she is just left as a blob on the ground- than when she started with her final dissolution. At least she has her own star on the floor, that is the only testament left to her former glory, but even that is eroding day after day.",38
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Yeah mukbang and ASMR in general are some of the most repulsive things I've ever encountered. I don't understand how people find it relaxing.,4
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I think the disconnect was because of her different mental state between bodies. Sue was like she was high, manic, powerful, but when she becomes Elizabeth, it’s the comedown, the morning after. Reality hits. They’re definitely the same.",33
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"im not so sure either, i felt it was separate consciousnesses that transferred memories during >!the switch? like the motorcycle transition and the belly button chicken leg both being dream sequences i took as the consciousnesses colliding, not really being able to tell exactly what happened but having the jist.!<",8
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I’m pretty sure they shared memories. The ad was very clear that there is no “them” and “you” but rather just one person. However the people taking it, like another said here, go into an almost mania state and so don’t consider the harm they do to themselves. It then becomes easy to view the other body as an entirely different person.",16
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Did you notice Sue had both eye colors when she woke up before fighting? I think that is a hint to the idea that they split there.,11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I think injecting some of the termination serum and then switching (after 1 day since last switch that was 3 months late) could have caused a weird side effect where the mind actually did split too. Before then, it was swapping into each body whenever the switch happened. But then breaking the rules in such a way leads to the mind splitting, like how later taking the activator again causes the cells to split multiple times.",9
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"That would negate the “there’s no she or me, only you” part that they emphasized a lot.",8
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I found the scene of Monstro getting ready for the show very touching. The way she stood in front of herself in that mirror. The way she didn't hesitate as she placed those earrings on her head. It felt like a moment of acceptance, and that was the medicine she needed all along.",12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This is being highlighted as a friction point for a lot of people in a number of reviews, but for me it worked on a sort of subliminal/intuitive level. In terms of what is shown in the movie, we clearly see a transference of perspective when Sue is ""born"" and the whole 2001 sequence occurs smashing into her first person POV. I took this as Elisabeth's consciousness being transported literally into Sue, so the same consciousness is operating for each week period in whatever body has been animated. I think the movie makes it unclear because we see Elisabeth and Sue both call the Substance company to complain about ""her"" actions, but I think this reflects the way that Elisabeth/Sue are unable to see the alternative body as belonging to them for various reasons that I can't fully articulate. Elisabeth cannot overcome her resentment even though she **is** Sue, and Sue doesn't seem able to see herself as Elisabeth; she steals the stabilizing fluid even though it's damaging the version of herself that...I guess she'll become? (It's **definitely** unclear what would happen if this situation didn't implode within the few months the movie spans IIRC; would Sue age into Elisabeth? Would she age at all? Does she only break down because they mutually abuse the system, or would she always have had a limited shelf life?)",8
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I completely disagree with the 8/10 and I am going to say 10/10 for sure on grossness. It is up there with the grossest of gross movies. Also their was def squeemish stuff, I cannot disagree more with fatherpain on this.",19
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Rated it as such because >!The body horror didn’t really involve violence!<and at no time did I feel squeamish, nauseated or had to look away…it’s been awhile since I’ve seen anything really gross, but relying on my old man memory, I’d say something like Re-Animator, Day of the Dead or anything that may involve people getting graphically eaten or tortured alive.",11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Yeah and dude didn’t even wash his hands before greeting his friend.,12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Unreality is a great way to describe so many elements in the movie. Like the fact that advertisements just say “the new show” but not on what channel, or how the late night show Sue goes on is just called “The Show” based off the note cards the host has",24
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Now I’m thinking about the diner scene again because her mocha latte magically appeared and my thought at the time was continuity error but now I’m thinking there’s a bunch of those moments,8
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Yeah, the idea that this might be a dying dream from her car accident is hanging in the air, since that's when the bizarrely convenient encounter with the nurse guy with the Substance happens

In a way it doesn't matter -- that random crash leads to her inevitable demise either way",7
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I really loved it, and 100% some of it could have been trimmed. ",6
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Nah the entire impetus of her decision is to enjoy that taste of eternal youth. I get her struggle.,6
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I also found it sad that when she looked at the door handle that was one moment where she went back into the bathroom. The door handle showed her a warped image of her face and she still accepted it as meaning she didn't look good enough. Like how even in a regular mirror we have warped opinions on our selves.,218
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Right it really had me reflecting on how we view women ageing in society. I’m 23 and I think Demi at 61 (which is also my beautiful mama’s age) is a million times more elegant and beautiful than I am at my age, and not just in her appearance, but because she has maturity and experience, a kind of worldliness about her and visible signs of a full, wonderful, and dynamic life she lived, if that makes sense. It really got me thinking about why we as a society fetishize youth so much. When I look at a woman who is 50 and older, I am struck by the beauty gained by the experiences that she had through the years. I feel like a baby adult who doesn’t know anything, I find so much beauty in older women who know who they are and have taken the time to learn themselves and know themselves, and who stand grounded in that.",181
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"His messages were so cute. When she didn't turn up, he at first asked ""are you okay"" instead of sounding angry.",9
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"My boyfriend totally didn’t get it. I’m like no. That feeling that you look awful and anything you try just makes you look worse and worse until you say fuck it and give up. 

I’m over 40 and I just don’t wear makeup because it just makes me look worse.",6
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I definitely think that twink nurse was interesting because you know how toxic the gay community is. I guarantee you that guy is gay and misses being young.,6
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I viscerally felt her terrified anxiety in the long pauses in their phone convo even though realistically I knew it must've been because he never expected her to go out with him in a million years,7
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"No idea - it was the most body horror I've seen in the movies in decades. Acerbic, funny, gross, culturally relevant, disgusting, gory... my god I loved it.",180
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I saw this yesterday at a 2 pm showing and it was just me and one other guy. He got up and left at the part where Qualley smashed Moore’s face into the mirror over and over… so almost 2 hours in! I guess if the gore was too upsetting or intense it makes sense, but I initially thought he just went to the bathroom and was SO eager for him to stroll in casually for… well, all of ElisaSue hahah. Sadly he ne’er returned!",69
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Other than Elisabeth 'birthing' Sue through her back early in the movie, I wasn't too impressed with the body horror. But then the last 30 minutes happened and it was so fun. I can't believe anyone would say it wasn't campy or gross enough--did they not see the ElisaSue monster doing her hair and accessories??",92
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Also pulling a whole chicken leg out your bellybutton is horrific.,14

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Horror seldom gets award attention, and especially this sort of gory, gross, exploitation type stuff. It will just be too much for most people. I haven't seen it and  although part of me really wants to, I am also worried I may puke in the cinema and nobody wants that! The grossest thing I have ever seen is Yuzna's Society and I couldn't even watch all of that. It was on tv and I changed channel for a while during ""the shunting""",9
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Definitely, it's just very rare that people who aren't women get it on a critical level.",11

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This was me too! My audience was laughing when Sue finally had to let Elisabeth take control again after months and she was looking at her hunchback self in the mirror, and then getting like pushed to the floor by Sue, filled with self-hate, feeling sad, pathetic and worthlessness, and i was like are we watching the same film? I didn't think those moments were funny, my heart was breaking and I was on the verge of tears 😭 I felt her pain so deeply within myself",11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"For what it's worth, I feel like the movie hits a point where you're just laughing out of shock and disbelief as much as anything. 


Agreed that things are heartbreaking for all three versions of Elizabeth by the end, though. ",12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Yup, I actually got quite upset and mad when I heard people laughing hard on the cinema.",9
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Yeah I hope she gets a lot of recognition for this role,41
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I keep seeing people referencing her bad plastic surgery. I must have missed that entire situation. And I’m wondering, did she get some fixes or did it settle into her face? Because I think she looks great now. Nothing seems off about her look, I think she looks like herself during the height of her fame, just 30-40 years older.

She was really incredible in this. I would be absolutely tickled if she got an Oscar nom but I know that’s a long shot.",27

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I totally agree. I just thought it was kind of funny since I've seen a lot of weird/""bad"" movies in theaters and this is the first time I've ever noticed anyone walk out and there was more than one. I totally understood why though.

Sucks you keep running into that. I rarely ever deal with bad theater goers and I go a lot since I have A-List, but my theater has always been pretty chill. 

Of course I try to not go to opening nights/weekends unless it's something I've been dying to see. 4-5 o'clock showings during weekdays are my bread and butter. I know not everyone can go to those showings though.",20

My husband even leaned over to them and said something which had them shut up for all of about 10 minutes.  I was so hyped for this film and I still quite enjoyed it but I wasn't able to fully immerse with mystery science theater duo blabbing the whole time. 🙄 might have to go for a second viewing",4
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Exactly 8 where I watched, with one elderly couple. No walk outs, and everyone was laughing a bit towards the end. It was a slow start, but it was worth it. Really fun film.",20

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Same with my screening.

That scene broke my heart.",13
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I felt the same, granted I’m a man, but that scene really made me feel sad for her, and was genuinely one of the scenes that got to me the most. ",7
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"That was an absolute gut wrenching scene and moved me deeply. The intensity of how she portrayed that utter sense of self loathing and disgust at what she sees, was almost more horror than the actual body horror. Terrifyingly recognizable.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"That's exactly how I interpreted it. When she was Sue, it was like she was high on life and being young. When Elizabeth was watching Sue on TV, it was like if you saw a video of a very drunk *you* the night before, and don't remember everything you did, and the way you were acting almost feels like it was someone else. There were different things motivating you and driving your actions at that time - you lived for the moment, and may not have even put your own safety first. Watching it later, you may feel regret, anger and embarrassment.",5
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Yeah.

Society loves when men age and get wrinkles and gray hair but when women age they have to age ""gracefully"" or it's a shame or a tragedy.

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Saw this one back on September 7th, advanced screening thang, and went in blind - I actively do not watch and avoid trailers, so I only had the idea that it was horror about wanting to look hotter, and that Margaret Qualley (who I love) was in it. But wow. Wow. One of the greatest cinema experiences I've had in a loooooong time, maybe ever, and I'm always at the movies, very up to speed with what's out and what's going on in film and horror in general. Felt like I was watching something I'd never seen before. Amazing. Going back on Thursday to watch for a second time as it hits wide release on the 19th.

Definitely a film that you need to see in a cinema. It could be watched, and enjoyed, at home, but it's certainly the kind of film that is really elevated by the cinema experience. Easily going to be one of the most talked about and biggest movies of the year, and already an instant cult (or maybe not) classic. Dammmmn.",101

I've been looking forward to this since the first trailer I saw, and it didn't disappoint. I don't even really classify this as horror, just fucking balls to the wall crazy. Every single thing about this movie was purposefully cranked to 10 and the 2+ hrs run time just completely flew by.  
I've read about some saying that it should have ended after the last bathroom mirror reveal scene, and I kinda understand that....but I'm so so glad it totally played itself out with every single outlandish detail cranked to 11 to the very bitter end.",72

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Saw last night, woke up this morning thinking about it.

This is how I can tell that the symbols are functioning as such. I suppose that’s my most basic test for whether a movie is any good.

This is why I watch horror movies. It seems the usual method of making video entertainment is to throw in some symbols, hope something sticks… And it seems that horror alone follows symbols to see where they lead, and then the filmmaker reports their discoveries honestly.

Just a few examples from the movie: the glass box in which Elizabeth lives overlooking the city, the entire bathroom lol, the hallway to the bathroom, which is inexplicably spiral inside the other otherwise cubic apartment, the hallway at the TV studio, the camera lens, the colors… god that pink is oppressive!

I was so suspicious that the movie came from an intellectual/social commentary perspective. The kind of movie that would have been better as an essay. But no, this is the real deal. A dream that shakes you and stays with you.

It’s a real exercise in empathy to watch this as a man. I feel like I learned something about my species in my time and place.

Anyway, it’s a very good movie. I feel the same drive to watch it again, unpack it, look under the hood to see how it works… The same way I used to with the Coen Brothers in their heyday (Barton Fink through Inside Llewyn Davis)

It’s very clever, very well-made, very true. 

Oh yes, and very funny. Though I was the only person in the movie theater laughing, which was surreal. Like, am I the only one seeing this?!",31

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Just saw it tonight and can’t stop thinking about it either. I avoid body gore at all costs so I put this one off and went in hesitantly, my hand halfway over my eyes. But by the first body gore scene I was entranced and couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. But the message, symbolism and overarching theme of this movie had me so hooked that I wasn’t bothered by the body gore. I felt empathy for her character as she sunk further into chasing her younger self + perfect face & body. She kept going, knowing there would be consequences, but she didn’t want to give it up. Body/beauty perfection can be addictive and often we don’t see the damage we do to ourselves until after it’s done. Extreme dieting, ED, cosmetic surgery, procedures, etc. taken to extreme lengths to achieve perfection, body dysmorphia, we end up hurting ourselves in the long run.) 
*recovering from an ED so a lot of this movie resonated with me*
Being accepting and happy with how we look as we age can be difficult, especially in a world of such demanding perfection for women to remain youthful and perky, while men age, look older, without being criticized or objectified. 
It’s polarizing and this movie did an amazing job at showing what a nightmare being objectified and chasing perfection can feel like. “Pretty girls should always smile.” Raise your hand if you cringe when men say that, and how young were you when a man first said it to you. I can’t wait to watch it again. Excellent movie; the best I’ve seen in a long time.",9

I tend to be weird about body horror--if it leans camp and over the top, I'm usually fine, but if it is too realistically visceral, I get grossed out. Slashers? One of my favorite genres! But I saw the Suspiria remake and the sequence with the dancer made me feel sick to my stomach.

I was okay with almost everything, shocked but okay nonetheless, the scariest aspect of the entire movie for me was that, this wasn't something that could've been controlled, and I mean that in the sense of, our genetic make-up and chemistry could all be altered by this tiny little vile of God knows what...

The way the rapid cell division took place was actually demonstrated quite well in my opinion and knowing the budget made it all the more better, the scientific aspect of the body horror made it all the more terrifying.

The desperation that sets in to become the best possible example of human genetics is ironic given the fact that you literally are manufacturing it rather than trying to embrace it

If anyone has watched the boys, you'd know that the side effects of V tend to leave an individual either deformed or looking some sort of way, *spoilers for the boys* the shape shifter in season 4 was on my mind the entire time throughout the viewing of this body horror masterpiece

It just seemed that the message could be a little more subtle, more nuanced. But it kept beating over the audience head with the message ""all men in the entertainment industry wants to use womens bodies for their evil intent mwhahaha"" Dennis Quaid is awesome in the role.

Parts of the plot were a little forced. You mean to tell me a Oscar winning wealthy famous celebrity would go, by herself, all alone, into that little dingy door? Fuck that. Could be an organ harvesting room, or for kidnapping, she doesn't know!! But noooo, she proceeds without a flicker of a doubt, because plot. Then, as Sue, she suddenly becomes a world class engineer who is capable of building a functional door in her bathroom, all by herself? Okay sure.

Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Oh yeah there's definitely that too - Keep in mind I haven't seen more than the trailers/some discussion, due to the trouble with body horror thing. 

I mostly got that from the trailers because it's very difficult to be a woman, much less one in showbusiness and NOT experience the horror of constantly moving beauty standards (both from society and from sometimes internalising those standards into unhealthy internal beliefs/addictions). So if she has access to those kinds of procedures/substances....yikes.",4
Can’t stop thinking about ‘The Substance’ ,1726145495.0,"Certainly the absurdity of moving standards, shown through horror, I would say. Demi Moore said something really interesting in an interview: “all of the grotesque stuff in this movie is stuff Elizabeth is doing to herself”. I think it’s a really good observation on the character, because she tries to stop and can’t because she’s desperate. Moore conveys all of this stuff so well. You can definitely read addiction, self-delusion, and loneliness in the movie.

It works on quite a few levels, while also just being a crazy fun time at the movies.",1

My coworker who watched The Conjuring because it was a hit won’t enjoy something deranged like Martyrs or whatever body horror seems to be feature in The Substance.

The film broadcasts the gore that’s coming though so you’ll have plenty of time to cover your eyes if you think you’ll feel ill.  By the time it’s Akira-esque we’re in like early Peter Jackson territory so you should be ok.

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"Fucking loved it. It feels like a classic. There's something about how prescient yet universal the themes are, how perfectly the sci-fi examines those themes, how perfectly the cast is, and how effective it is both on an emotional, thematic level, but also as a gonzo, over the top, gleefully distasteful B movie. It feels like a new pillar of body horror that we'll talk about in the same context as The Thing and The Fly.

It's also the rare horror movie that swings bigger and bigger all the way to the end. It really goes for it, and whether or not you think it's fully successful, you can't deny the ambition and execution and the sheer spectacle of it.

Also, as many have already pointed out, the shrimp scene made me actually look away. The rest of the film was nightmarish and disgusting, but the shrimps were the worst for me by far lol",9

However, the film treats the audience like an idiot. I don’t need flashbacks and callbacks to stuff that’s already happened in the film to remind me of a plot point, it’s not a series. Also was a great message but didn’t need it spelt out for me so much at the end.

The super close ups of something with a bass beat drop or gross noise got old quick, and as much as I liked the effects in the beginning of the film, what we saw near the end was so comically bad it took me out of it. At one point Demi Moore looked like Spike Jonze as an old woman from the Jackass movies. I think there were a lot of cool parts to the film though, just presented poorly and with no restraint. I’m just a spoiled film snob that’s seen everything though. Some late teen/early 20 year old is going to see this movie and it’s going to be their gateway to looking for more messed up films, and that’s ok with me.",5

It felt like the principle desire was to get hurridly to certain scenes without really investing in the moments in between. This meant I felt a bit disengaged apart from the obvious shocking bits. 

I think the concept of a “you are one” is very interesting and I think can lead to misconceptions about what is going on. I think Sue is more of a child of Elizabeth than a conscious sharing being but Elizabeth allows and wants Sue to continue in the way a parent may continue to support a child as much as they lose their own life and individualism (eg a parent drops their kid off for soccer practice).

It was like a parable or a fairy tale, which I get, and it was hilarious, but not my thing as much.

I can see how this film will appeal to a tiny vocal minority of horror fans but mainstream audiences are either bored to death or getting up to leave when they can't take anymore punishment(which I think is what the director wanted to do). The final act in the film is so ludicrous and frankly dumb that I thought only  a French director would try this. Sure enough got home and found it was made in France.,15

The artsy ones that letterboxd users like don't tend to really be scary so I don't personally consider stuff like Midsommar or The Lighthouse horror even though I love them. This however is my favorite horror movie that actually unnerved me. Great film. My only complaint is that they drive the message of body issues down your throat so much in the end scene. Like obviously that's what the whole movie is about but the end scene just takes you out of the action to drive it home and I found it redundant. Other than that it is amazing,1
Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"Spectacular.

I attended a scream unseen screening the other week, and was overjoyed that it was The Substance, a film I've been excited about since I saw a brief teaser trailer, and as a big fan of Revenge, I was very excited, although after Long Legs failed to deliver, I was wary of letting myself get too hyped for another horror film this year, and expectations were tempered going in.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

It went places I truly wasn't expecting, and had become my film of the year so far.",1
Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"
Just finish seeing it a half hour ago in the theater.  My my initial thoughts: 

Holy god. 
One of the years best, easily. But holy god.

- so many Kubrick references and homages, as well as DePalma and Lynch. And Cronenberg . Both Senior and junior. Even a little Billy Wilder.

- I hope Demi Moore gets recognized for an absolutely fearless performance.

- Best make up and special effects - much of it had to have been practical - I've seen this year.

- holy god

- what is it with French directors and surreal, absurdist body horror? Feels very much in the spirit of Titane.

- the last 30 minutes are fucking wild.",1
Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"Really loved it, until the last 15 minutes or so.

Feel like it could've been paced better (there was clear fat to be cut) and some points maybe missed the mark emotionally (laughter when - at least personally I felt - there shouldn't be) and it completely throws subtlety out the window but my god that last 30-50 minute stretch was worth the price of admission alone.",27
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a screening with that many people that silent for quite some time. About just over half full in Bath and you could tell everyone was captivated by that story almost from start to finish. Also haven’t heard an audience that buzzed or chattering opinions that much for some time after, too. Only one walkout from what I saw: just as Sue’s first show was being shot. 

I think the term Cronenbergian is used a bit too much in regards to body horror, but the satirical style of this really reminded me of the likes of Crash and Videodrome, particularly in regards to the growing prosthetics and makeup. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were both great, although Dennis Quaid stole the show in his scenes. 

There’s a real conflict of the horror and humour at times - the cooking/ chat show scene walks the thin line between the two perfectly. And there’s a good deal of fear factor and tension aside from the body horror elements. Certainly a lot to unpack here, and I look forward to doing so.",18

There were a few old people in the audience and I walked past them on the way out. Two of the ladies had their heads in their hands and looked genuinely traumatised.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I felt the movie was way too long with many unnecessary elements. The drug didn’t need to be a black market replenishment situation— it took away from the aspect of her having to find balance. (It felt like she was at the mercy of the drug supplier as well as her own discipline, but it didn’t end up mattering). The long scene renovating the bathroom to hide the body was unnecessary, just drag it into a closet and we’re good. Two hours and 20 minutes—just not necessary— and so many unbelievable moments besides the ones that were supposed to be unbelievable. You can’t show up for a performance on New Year’s Eve at a major without a rehearsal and just find a way on stage. When the older version of her could barely move and then suddenly could run and fight? Many things could be tightened up or left out to make it less insulting to the audience and let the good parts shine.",4

She has something to say about beauty standards, about overt sexualisation and how the strive for perfection is so ingrained that women will often be their own worst critics - the scene where Elisabeth is preparing for her date but no matter what she’ll never be as “perfect” as Sue is uncomfortably realistic - while at the same time showing the power and addiction of beauty and why it’s allowed to be a part of our culture.

And she tells that message in the most gonzo, blood-drenched, in-your-face, WTF way possible to make it stick. Holy shit that is the most batshit final act of the year.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Needed somewhere to discuss so hope it’s okay to jump in 😅 as a woman that is closer to 40 than 30, there was a lot of the societal commentary that hit very close to home. The impossible beauty standards that become internalised, the male gaze and misogyny, fear of ageing and the loss of identity when losing your career due to nothing other than being seen as too old, lack of self-confidence in your value beyond how you look, the consequences brought to your later self by selfish choices and not caring for the impact or for your future wellbeing, the fear of abandonment and desperate need to be loved … and that’s just what hit a personal note, let alone the rest!

(And one element I’ve not seen discussed yet is that of the role of Elizabeth as the “mother”, and very much like the pushy beauty pageant moms that make their kids live out what they never could or to relive their glory days through them.) 

I was told by my partner this was a “body horror comedy”, and I went in without knowing anything else about it. I am not a fan of horror, and wouldn’t choose to watch anything that makes me too squeamish. My fingers were over my eyes several times 🙈 I said to my partner, “if this is a comedy just like Barbarian was a thriller, you’re in trouble” 😂 I’ve gotta say as disturbed as I was by it in many parts, it is incredibly thought provoking.

The film was a throwback to 80's body horror films such as Basket Case and Society. The effects were very well made and hope this film gets the props it deserved. Great acting by Demi Moore, need to cast her in more Horrors, and Margret Qualley was great too. Dennis Quaid was great but his character was probably the only bad part of the film as thet went overboard with the stereotyping.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I don't normally get to see Unseen films these days, as I'll generally go at the weekend for a binge, so whatever's shown on these, I'll see in due course. However, with all the older films being shown, I saw Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Spidey Homecoming and Batman Forever yesterday, and Star Wars 3 then Substance today. Next weekend, there's about 6 films vying for my attention.

Anyway, I hadn't read up anything about the film so had just seen the trailer, but to say it was weird is an understatement. It was like a Cronenberg film, but without the name, albeit quite a slow start that I'd mostly skip over if I was going to watch it again. I'm toying between 8.5-9/10.

Plus, the same female director made 2018's brilliant Revenge, which hand plenty of gore, and is basically the ‘Kill Bill’ that Tarantino should have made, as I thought those two films were lacking overall.

I was sat in the front section of seating at Trafford Centre, so I don't know if anyone walked out (although a lot of people sounded like they used the toilet a great deal. Jeez, go beforehand!), but one guy left in the front section after 54 mins.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"A great experience but I don't think it's a film that I'm likely to revisit. It was enjoyable but didn't have as much to say as I wanted it to.

As many have said, The Substance isn't concerned with subtlety or nuance.  It's got one point to make, a sledgehammer and some inspired body horror.

There are obvious comparisons that can be made, but the one I'm stuck on is Under the Skin. I think they share a lot of the same DNA - bold, bonkers, divisive and heavily stylised. I love to rewatch Under the Skin though. It speaks to me in a way that The Substance didn't. 

I appreciated the satire but I don't know how successful it was. It's a film about the male gaze but it never subverts that - it's just very male gazey. It wants to satirise figures like Harvey Weinstein and Vince McMahon, but Harvey gets no comeuppance, instead he gets a lot of laughs. It wants to satirise society's insane reactions to women aging but turns Demi Moore into a monstrous hag who becomes insanely jealous of a younger woman's success and then dies horrifically.

I'm glad I saw it. I had fun with it. It ticked so many boxes for me (show me gross shit accompanied by noises that make you feel like you're losing your mind, I'm normally happy). I'm not sure I thought it was a great film though.",1

That whole second act was painful to get through for me, and those two breaks I took were during that act. 

Third act was easier for me to stomach completely, much easier for me to stomach compared to that anxiety inducing second act.

Possibly the best film I would never go see again, it was kinda wonderful seeing how uncomfortable I was watching this film but fuck me, do I wish I had an empty stomach coming in.",1

Felt like the movie overstayed its welcome IMO. The big finale scene with the audience didn’t land for me, either. But the last image on the Walk of Fame was pretty great and just bizarre/hilarious.

I think the movie was good, but could have ended like 10-15 minutes earlier.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"SPOILER ALERT
I'm not a guy who particularly cares about morals in media, but imo the message of the film conflicts somehow with how it is described in the reviews: in the narrative world the substance can be used indefinetly if applied as prescribed (""maintaining the balance""), a fact which avoids an honest reckoning with the ultimate futility of maintaining immortal beauty/control of bodily functions. so it boils down to the following: the failings of the users is an individual fault, and the elizabeth/sue monstrosity in the grand finale is an object of ridicule. - so I think the film somehow fails in this regard. with it's handling of topics of sexism, ageism in the industry, body shame, reproduction etc the movie is somehow clustered and all over the place, a lot of cool ideas and allegories half-exposed and discussed. - this out of the way: I think the movie is great at conveying the bodily horror technically, it's male gazing zooms on frantically swinging hips and oozing wounds. Moore's performance during the first half (when the tone of the movie strikes a better balance between the comic and the tragic) is superb - contrast it to the scene where she cooks and watches Sue in the tv, where the ""comedic"" and audience distance took way overhand imo. qualley's performance is great too, but I quickly got fed up with the shots on her - the technical critique of the male gaze gets repetetive quite fast imo. really enjoyed the sound.

I find the quieter shots on Moore's body really interesting: thematizing cosmetic surgery. her lips in the wakeup shot, her buttocks when she's about to take the activator.",1

It all went relatively well for the first hour, so I thought they would touch on delicate sensitive topics, such as aging and feminism.

 So from a Story perspective it makes total sense to get the plot somewhere and spiral into that twisted gory nightmare, we 've all seen.
But beeing in her situation, give the fact 207 hinted that it would happen.
I would take back my 1 day even if it just postponed the inevitable.

That said, the one thing I really wanted to know that was left out/vague and kind of ruined the logic of the movie is: How much, if at all, did the new and old versions of Elisabeth experience their counterparts’ lives and consciousness?

The drug’s premise is you get to live a better life as a younger you, but in the movie, Elisabeth and Sue are constantly surprised by what the other did when they were asleep. It’s like they have no idea what happens in the other’s life.

So, what’s the point if old Elisabeth’s consciousness doesn’t live on in some capacity in Sue, and she can’t reap the rewards of being young and beautiful?",1

In contrast, the characters in this film barely spoke, making it a masterclass in 'show, don't tell,' which left me far more satisfied as an audience member. Both films tackle similar ideas and critiques, including satirizing corporate men, and they share a stylized presentation of these themes.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I loved the movie. Yes it was way too long and the pacing wasn't perfect, but the atmosphere it creates is intense. The cinematography is also spot on. The two leading ladies carry the whole movie. Good use of prosthetics.

The most disturbing scenes are not the violent or body horror ones which are not even that intense, but the fear of ageing and the obsession we have for the passing of time, opportunities, fame/exposure and our past selves. The scenes where Demi looks in the mirror and then compares herself to Sue and constantly touches up her make up and her outfit are so heavy and everybody I think can relate, especially people past 25 who are starting to see the signs of ageing and the first changes in their appearance, men AND women.

The moments where she is hopeful and then everything turns for the worst well represents the risks and foolish things people are willing to take and do to look young. And it can be anything: drugs, diet, digital filters, fillers, surgery, fake teeth, fashion choices...

I hoped the feminist elements wouldn't be as pronounced as I think this is, in different ways, a universal experience especially in our modern social media mediated times. But the meta element of an ageing celebrity played by someone who was recently scrutinized for her facial procedures and looks was also a boss move on Demi's part.

Another detail that I found disturbing was the lack of information provided with the substance: it really captures today's beauty market so well with tons of energy based and at home devices and products that are sold with little care and scientific studies and people use them with little guidance and knowledge... a growing phenomenon is severe facial fat loss induced by microcurrent, lasers and radiofrequency devices. This was captured flawlessly in how Elizabeth jumps on The Substance with little hesitation and little care for the whole process, even when things starts getting weird. And the meth addict symptoms were poignant as well.

As for the finale, I loved the camp ending, it helps balance the uneasiness of the central/later part of the movie but I guess there were a couple of other directions the movie could have gone and explored so even if it is not a masterful scene per se, it was able to surprise me. But it was a fun scene that clearly pays homage to a cult classic and gives a strong statement about how, at least in hollywood but in modern times in general, the ""audience"" is what feeds this narrative and this obsession for beauty and youth, so everybody is guilty in the end and the whole splatter thing is a release of all the nasty emotions embodied by the monster. 

In the end, it's one of those great movies that stay in your head for a while and create a sense of uneasiness but also offer a chance for profound thinking, and it is technically well done and effective.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I haven’t seen this anywhere yet so I might be wrong, but did they use The Caretaker’s “it’s just a burning memory” in the scenes where Elisabeth was walking down those long orange corridors at the studio?

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"This is if Cronenberg, Lynch and Verhoeven made a movie but more visually striking than Refn. This movie is the definition of unapologetic. I was not ready for how much everything escalated by the end, and the movie was not shy or subtle about the points it was making. I was blown away by the starking visual contrast between ""beauty"" and ""ugliness"" and yet the movie made them both gross and sexual at the same time to ultimately expose us, the viewers, for our unhealthy gaze.

The substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves. The paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless. This is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm. We wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder! It shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions. We are covered in our own blood. The walls are covered in blood.

Yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody. Every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character. We see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain.

Our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too. And she does not hold back. Yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd. The comedy in this movie is absolute gold. The villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious. The absurdity of this movie is so refreshing.

In terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate. It is never stagnant, but it's also not in a rush. After all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage.

This is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped. My only note would be I wish they didn't do the hamfisted voice overs at the end. I know most viewers would have missed that point. But I don't think it would have taken away from the movie. Maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as Easter eggs for the second watch. Really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience. 9.8/10.

P.S. I gotta say while watching this I kept thinking about the barbie movie. Every safe choice, absurd self important and alienating point barbie made, this movie undid! I loved this movie with the same energy I hated the barbie!",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Just saw it today, and wow, I thought it was brilliant, though some in my audience seemed to think it was over the top, especially by the end. To me, I've never seen a movie quite like this, and mad props to Fargeat for executing something so personal with such a high level of artistry and confidence and Moore and Qualley for allowing themselves to be so emotionally and physically vulnerable to put this on screen. For as darkly funny as much of this movie is, it's really got a big emotional heft, and Moore carries a lot of that with her performance and walks the balance of the emotional part and the absurdist black comedy so well. It can be a tough watch, not just because of the gore really, but honestly because Moore's character almost feels like she's at war with herself. Her character's self-hatred and self-abnegation is just crushing to watch on screen. In a lot of ways, the movie feels so much like a psychological horror movie as well before it goes full on body horror extravaganza in the final act. I really think that is because we are so pulled into the interiority of Elizabeth/Sue, to the point that the movie even switches to their first person perspective in several instances. 

I personally loved the ending; for me, it was like pulling the release on a valve and just releasing the pressure on all these heavy emotions and ideas building throughout the movie and almost was like a relief. Oddly enough, I actually found the ending to be the least nauseating; it was just so outlandish that it just kinda became hysterical and full-on satire at that point. The movie up to that point just has this heaviness and tension to it because you really do feel sorrowful for what Moore's character is experiencing; the final sequence just feels like one giant fuck you and condemnation to the whole hollywood culture around youth and beauty and like the ultimate way to ridicule it.

The first 2/3 of the movie definitely had my stomach churning at certain points (surprisingly the worst being watching Dennis Quaid eat shrimp). A lot of the food stuff in particular was just so nasty to me. I think people will be surprised about the moments in this movie that are emotionally disturbing and anxiety-inducing. Moore's scene in front of the mirror where she just kept going back actually made me so anxious because the self-doubt and emotional turmoil was so relatable, and you can feel the desperation and sadness she is going through. The body switch sequences were almost clinical and I felt like it just tapped into all these anxieties and fears around watching our bodies deteriorate and being poked and prodded by doctors as we get older. And Qualley's dance sequences were just so uncomfortable with the music and the camera movements. I was just really amazed how this movie almost felt like it was breathing through the screen with a lot of the textures and sounds. The sound, set design and makeup are just superb and just make this film such a sickening joy to watch. 

Maybe it's hyperbole, but to me it really feels like one of the most unique visions I've seen in a film in a long time. I really can't wait to watch it again, the first time is such an assault on the senses that it's definitely hard to process this film in one go.",1

Did anyone else leave feeling like they had to be kinder to people?  I don't mean to sound pathetic, but that never happens to me.

I was sort of frustrated that she didn't have any friends or family in her Elizabeth Sparkle time period.  No siblings, long-term friends, anything like that.... and of course ugly people have friends too - maybe not as many - but it went to show that it reminded me that you need to make an effort and that fewer people care about what you look like (when you aren't a total monster...and even if you are, it's probably not your fault).

A lot of messages in media might say 'Don't chase glitz and glamour' but few do it in such a  surreal and imaginative way.

The Substance is a high-budget B-grade film purporting to critique Hollywood, sexism, aging ostracism, and the overall beauty industry. However, its execution feels reminiscent of a self-indulgent adolescent's misguided attempt at profundity.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Agreed, there was a lot of vocal responses in my theatre too which made it so much more entertaining. I saw a bunch of people commenting that audiences were ""laughing at a woman's pain"" which is like oh Jesus get off your damn high horse. People can laugh at a movie for a lot of reasons, sometimes its just to release tension. Now if this were the rape scene in Irreversible and people were laughing that would be a different story, but this film was genuinely absurd and wild and entertaining in all the right ways. ",1

I didn't hate the last 20-30 mins like some people seemed to, but it would have been brilliant if it ended at the point you mention. Would have left me personally with some serious chills. ""Oh crap, she did the thing the writing specifically told her not to, she used the activator again and basically divided by zero, and this is how she ended up - *now what?*"", roll end credits.

The last half hour was all good and mind blowing, but I felt like I'd reached the cumulative gross out factor and yet it kept on coming.  Hocking up the boob was the comic grossness needed to keep me in it.

It was too long, and it seemed like they kept it rolling because they had so many ideas still at the end that the filmmakers didn't want to cut.  At the end, though, it all made sense and finished with tied up plot points.",3

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"One or two moments of flashing and fast lights - largely just after The Substance itself is taken and the ‘other self’ is unveiled. Also as one of the central characters’ grows more famous there may be occasional moments of paparazzi-like camera flashes, although these are somewhat infrequent. The BBFC does have a photosensitivity warning on its website for the film though, which is usually a fairly good indicator.

Not sure if it’d have a similar effect, but there’s also some pretty rapid editing here and there. A car crash scene early on and also during scenes where a fitness/ workout show is being filmed (actually may also be some flashing lights as part of this). Third act in general also might have combinations of both due to some of the events and settings, where the combination of things might just make everything seem that bit more intense(?), but obviously no spoilers. 

Overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there. I think generally though, if you’ve seen the trailer in the cinema (which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts) that might give you a good indication of what some of the film’s sequences might be like? Apologies if this spiel is completely unhelpful, especially as it kind of summarises as an over-rambly ‘I don’t know’.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"My interpretation is that they’re the same person, but neither can accept the other. Her younger self hates her older body and neglects her, while her older self resents her for being young and getting all the love she craves. The movie is about not accepting who you are—your appearance, and the fact that you’re getting older—so she develops this personality disorder. That’s how I see it.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"She sucked it dry. I guess the guy on the phone said it replenishes itself with every switch after 7 days but bc she just went balls to the walls with it, it ran out.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I’d say if she struggled with Poor Things then The Substance is a step above that, especially in terms of blood and gore - it’s certainly rightfully got a strong 18 rating. The moments of body horror in particular are prolonged - especially in the final 20 minutes or so, and key uses and effects of ‘the substance’. It’s also something that hangs over the film and its events as a whole.

Edit: Looking at the BBFC’s content description/ insight for the film (may be worth having a look at but can contain possible spoilers) there’s a lot written in the injury detail section. There is quite a bit in that film that gets pretty intense, particularly in terms of detail.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Idk how specific her trauma is, but there’s a lot of scenes involving injections, IV’s, bodily injuries, etc. There is one scene actually in a hospital, but some other scenes also involve very sterile environment which feel hospital-like.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Sounds like you just struggle with movies that involve ramped to sudden tonal shifts because the third act ramps up into such absurdism.

I guess it was because they wanted to really drive home the “male gaze” thing, but it still seems a little gross. Overall, I liked the movie a lot, but not nearly as much as I expected to given all the glowing reviews. I get the purpose of a lot of the nudity and hyper-sexualization in the “Sue” chapter, but at a certain point I felt like I was just watching the same thing over and over and over and it was no longer serving the plot in any way. I just saw it tonight, so I’m still unpacking it, but initially the absurdist ending really threw me for a loop as well and I kind of felt like it cheapened the entire message.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I have the same issue, it isn't clear what the older version gets out if it and how they feel less alone.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Just talked loudly all the way through the movie trying to crack jokes despite being told to be quiet at least once. Just a wanker.,2
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Not the OP but I thought the first 2/3 were great commentary on youth and beauty with excellent acting. Then I was taken out of the visuals and acting by the over the top batshit ending. To each their own but it ruined the whole experience for me.,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Not the comment you are replying to but I hated it. Like, I feel genuine anger about how much I hated it.

The message was so surface level and in your face. They did nothing to subvert it, just had excessive close ups of ""look at this old haggard woman of 50! Now look at the hot 20 something!"" which it plays straight for so long that by the time we get to the over the top final third, I was just waiting for it to be over and couldn't even bring myself to enjoy the batshit body horror I came for. Like we are supposed to think the characters pursuit of youth and beauty is foolish, even though in the weird make believe reality of the world life is over for a 50 year old Demi Moore, forced to hide away in her home and gorge herself on meat because she's past her prime. 

There was 0 characterisation beyond ""she's old and ugly therefore sad"" and ""she's young and hot therefore happy"". Which made me utterly unable to engage in her plight. Was surprised to find it was directed by a woman, because I could have sworn whoever responsible for that claptrap had never met a woman in their lives. 

Stupid movie that thinks it's being smart but utterly fails to say anything that hasn't already been said before in far better ways. I'm shocked a majority of people enjoyed it, I was bored stiff from start to end.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Are you referring to Tetsuo The Iron Man? Need to find this as it looks so cool. Any film that the film makers decide to use black and white as they didn't think audience would not watch to end if in colour, is bound to be good.",2
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Was super stoned, only ate munchies, didn't eat much actual food, had to throw up what munchies I did eat instead in the jacks, wasn't my brightest hour, was brief as shit, came back and she was just hooking herself up to her food source etc.

My friend blames the weed.  
I don't think it was the weed since high tolerance. But I definitely felt anxious throughout and I don't think the weed was the source as much as I'd love to claim it was for my ego's sake. Definitely was one of the most anxiety inducing moments I've seen in any film. 

EDIT: Noticed I didn't say what scene it was, it was the splitting scene.

Monstro Elizabeth was grand for me, totally grand. Can't do needles though nor could I hack her sewing Elizabeth back together, came back after my smoke during the sorta realization that she needs to 1000% switch body back to her old self, missing most of the parts where Sue is living her best life.

Definitely walked out of that cinema feeling like I couldn't have a wank for a week.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"This was more than I could’ve asked for. Thank You 💙 👍

I'm a bit more confident going in now. Though I'm lowkey apprehensive for this third act everyone’s raving about. I hope it contains nothing severe but at least moderate (?) I don’t know this stuff either 😅",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Damn, that’s unfortunate. I’m new to this flashy stuff but not to that extent luckily. I too wish there was some outlet that could let people know that stuff beforehand.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Awesome, appreciate you letting me know. I might have to skip taking her to this one since she had a hard time with The Fly. Might just be a watch at home movie once it releases then.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,yeah it was a little unclear to me until the end whether she was transferring her consciousness each time she switched or whether sue was a separate consciousness who just had elisabeth’s memories up to the point of her activation of the substance,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,This whole thing is what confused me too. It seemed like Elisabeth was not experiencing what Sue was while it was her turn. So that makes me wonder why Elisabeth would want to continue the deal if she didn’t get to actually experience what Sue was experiencing.,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,yeah that’s what i thought was happening at first until the two of them were both awake at the same time and started fighting,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I found the 'getting ready for the date' scene really sad too. As a woman closer to 50 than 40, it really made me think about body image and how we need to learn to love the body and face we're given.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Somehow I missed that part, but how do you stabilize as old part for the 7days.
I guess I'll have to watch it again.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,For me it’s how it showed the old women body and spread the insecurities around it even more.,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Exactly!,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I don’t think that thinking really works, though, because it doesn’t explain why Elisabeth doesn’t stop the experiment after she wakes up the first time and realizes she has no memory of her younger self’s experiences.

Or the second time she wakes up.

With other procedures (Botox, fillers, face lift, implants, etc.) there is a tangible, immediate benefit/outcome.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Completely agree! Kinda ruined some of the film for me, as I found Demi to be much moore (see What i did there?😂) attractive than qualley. Demi is Soo Damn fine, qualley is more girl next door with a good body.",2

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Agreed, me and my girlfriend liked it until the last 15ish minutes. Just too gross for me, personally i wish they went a different route with the ending but am glad tons of other people enjoyed the ending.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Haha! I think I let out a surprised “Oh!” with the fingernail. 😅,3
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Yeah. The “I’m still me” was kinda heartbreaking. It’s probably not going to be something that I go back to regularly, but it’s a good film to sit with and meditate on…",2

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I just got finished watching it and I’m still thinking through everything so this isn’t a fully formed thought but I think a major reason they made it like that at the end is to show the absolute tipping point of feminine rage and/or the pure vulnerable rawness of rejection to your core at the realization that you were only idolized like a god and “loved by everyone” when you were pretty with no inner substance. Like, I’m thinking that that feeling is the equivalent of bleeding out over everyone if it were to be put into a discernable image",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"You’re welcome, happy I could be of some help.

From what I remember the elements of the third act probably seem more intense just because of the directions the film grows rather than the intensity of the lights, etc. So, generally, as I say, if you’ve been fine with the trailer the film should be alright. I hope you’re able to enjoy the film and sit through it ok if you see it when it comes out!",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,i had the same confusion. i was wondering why demi didn’t know what margaret had done and vice versa.,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"At the time, I still believed it was her, but now I think she's split between two bodies, especially since she comes back at the end, even after being killed. We don't fully understand how the drug works, so it's open to interpretation I guess.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I just watched the movie a few hours ago and it only ever showed the new version stabilizing herself with injections.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,The ‘body’ wasn’t real. Prosthetic boobs and bum!,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I watched it at the Alamo, which had trailers and clips from a bunch of different aerobics and past videos of roles. 

Margaret knows how to love the camera as well as anyone. My favorite concept from the movie is that sue IS the same person. She's channeling young Demi, as well as the characters vision of what she wants to be. I think they can both be true.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I mean, there's nothing wrong with comparing looks, it's just an observation. I think the point of the film isn't ""don't compare physical beauty"" but that self love must be paramount and isn't skin deep.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Thank you, was careful not to do that because I avoided the trailer I was anticipating the film so much excitement so wouldn’t want to spoil it given many won’t have the chance to have seen it yet (assumed anyone in here will have though!) 

I just hope as many people as possible get to see this. Wasn’t completely packed in my screening tonight but happy to say no walkouts",2

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I think the excess was the point, doing whatever it takes to be a star. Even if that means crawling around with your mutilated squid body to feel seen and loved again. I kinda didn’t know if I liked this movie or just respected it but I can’t stop talking about it.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"**H Y P E !** 🔥 🔥 🔥 👏 

I was just so let down by 'Alien' in that later half, having to miss a lot of cause of this issue. This funny epitome hit me in the theater like 😱 ***""I CANNOT. LET THIS RUIN THE SUBSTANCE!""***  (this one's been my no.1 priority all year)

So what you’re saying eases me for sure. Glad to hear it doesn’t go to a severity like that, flashing light-wise yes. 👍",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Thank you both! I ended up going alone and honestly it was not as gross as I thought. I think it's true what they say about our minds making things scarier/grosser. Strangely enough I did end up re-evaluating some stuff after the movie, so there is that. But yeah, good thing I didn't take her, she would have walked out.",1

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"This echoes Titane's reactions. And who remembers that movie now? Shock value movies are good for this - stirring up conversation, getting a bunch of people online write ""OMG, you won't believe this"" posts, and maybe satisfying the core fan group who likes that sort of thing.

Cannes in general is kind of an odd place, with those reported 9 minute or so standing ovations for every movie. It's a circle jerk, this is part of it and it probably will be forgotten.

And honestly, I have no idea why movies like this, Titane or The House that Jack Built don't choose to debut at SXSW, or some other thematic festival...they could get more genre hype behind them and a well-timed release could then make them into decent/good box office hits. Whereas by debuting at Cannes, these films act like they are high brow art, when body horror is really a niche (and rather weird) subgenre, they get some online/critic hype and then tank in cinemas.

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"Next year's Oscar race in the best actress category is at this point seemingly going to be Amy Adams vs Saoirse ronan and their movies on paper seem like they have a shot. I doubt this Cannes hype will last until awards season and Saoirse is kinda overdue. 

And actually, considering Emma Stone just got an Oscar for pretty much playing a sex obsessed prostitute, in explicit scenes, I think audiences/awards committees are interested or not against edgy material, but is anyone interested on awards level interested in a body horror that is another play at ""Hollywood likes only younger women?"" What is the message? Demi Moore who at 60 still looks better than most and who made her entire career on looking hot, because she never was much of an actress and she's a millionaire is questioning why she doesn't get cast anymore that much? I'm not really seeing how the business did her bad when she got 20 million I think, the then highest salary for any woman, for Striptease which was sold only on her nudity and hotness. So basically the reality is, if you're young and hot and not much of an actress, when you start getting older, Hollywood and showbiz moves on. I don't see this happening to people like Jodie Foster, Cate Blanchett, etc., maybe because they actually are good? Not sure how that's something evil. And even moreso, what men over 60 are treated by showbiz like hotness? I'm not seeing that too either, older men too have to kinda fight father time to stay in the loop.",-5

Pearl definitely deserved a nomination in my eyes too but I think the performance was too “big” for the academy, as opposed to them not nominating a horror movie. It’s easy to just say “overacting” and dismiss those kinda performances.

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"What I’m saying is horror does get nominated a decent amount. Get Out, Black Swan, The Sixth Sense, Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist, The Omen, Misery, Rosemary’s Baby, Carrie, The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth, Sweeney Todd and Jaws all were heavily nominated or even won big at the Oscars. 

But most of those tend to have pretty subdued performances as opposed to Malignant style acting. 

It’s easy to say the academy doesn’t like horror but horror has won best picture multiple times. I think it’s more that larger than life and borderline campy horror movies are more discriminated against. Pearl, Hereditary, The Babadook, Us, The Shining and Midsommar all deserved acting noms but all those movies had actors hamming it up and I think that’s the bigger thread connecting them than just the academy not liking horror. 

Cause Jodie Foster, Cathy Bates and Natalie Portman have Oscars for horror movies. And that’s putting aside nominations like Toni Collette in The Sixth Sense (for my money, one of my favorite performances ever). But you can never go full ham in a horror movie and expect a nomination.",3

And I only mention it because you said Black Swan, Silence of the Lambs and The Sixth Sense arguably weren’t horror enough. I’m comfortable saying all of them are horror, but I can argue that it’s mostly a suspense movie until it transitions to supernatural horror in the last few minutes. 

Overall, I’d say the academy is more allergic to “big” performances that rub up against overacting than they are to horror. There’s lots of horror Oscar nominations in the last few decades but they seem to only like the subdued horror movies.",0

I know it’s a satirical, humorous, and overt message about aging, beauty standards, and the male gaze but despite the campy tone at times I actually found this movie to be quite sad at its heart.

Demi Moore hasn’t been in many projects in years and is now in her early 60s. For her to do this indie left of center French horror film when she doesn’t have to—to be this aging character that had been put out to pasture—i just found her performance really courageous and vulnerable. 

The scenes with her alone as Elizabeth were heart breaking to me especially when she stands her date up because of her self hatred towards her appearance. And how she falls further into isolation and depression due to her compare/despair mentality and how invisible and ugly she perceives she is. I actually teared up at times because I saw myself in certain parts. Like how many times I’ve changed clothes before I date, looking in the mirror multiple times, eating junk when I’ve felt sad, etc. 

I think this movie is a great metaphor about self-hatred, how it leads to addiction, and the distortions and deformations both those things cause when we don’t have a sense of self that is free from the hostile unrealistic standards of society.",56

It just covers off so many different genres and elements in one movie - Hollywood satire, critique of beauty standards, commentary on aging in the media, how women see themselves as the approach 50, wild body-horror, dissection of misogyny, takedown of celebrity, black comedy.... it's many things.

I'm really looking forward to it getting a general release so I can see how it goes down with the general public, because that film goes pretty wild, and the trailers (up until now) do a decent job of not really giving away just how wild it gets.

Reading womens' opinions on it is going to be very interesting. All my female friends and mutuals came away incredibly positively about it.",48
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Does anyone else feel this film overstays it’s welcome by like 25 minutes. The credit cut in the bathroom where she turns into the final monster would have been a perfect cut.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I just saw it and I loved it, it’s one of those WTF did I just watch films but it’s bloody, gory and gross in some scenes. But it’s definitely worth watching.",13
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I went into this one blind. I hate how trailers give so much away. All I knew was that it was described as a ""body horror"" and people said it was twisted. 

This was probably the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years. The cinematography was beautiful. The internal struggle in Elizabeth was heartbreaking and I also related to Sue. The clear commentary on agism, the beauty standard, plastic surgery and the desperate clawing for youth was not lost on me. 

But what really made me sad in the activation stage was how Sue just left Elizabeth on the bathroom floor. Didn't close her eyes. Didn't try to move her to a more comfortable position. Didn't try to set up a cot or something for her. It was like the self hatred was palpable from the beginning. 

My only question was - they were one - but did they really remember each other's experiences? When the consciousness was being shifted back and forth between bodies, did Sue have the mindset of a 20 year old? Or was Sue/Elizabeth still a 50 year old consciousness who was desperate to be in a 20 year old body? Was that the self-hatred aspect as well? Or even just an agism of the self? Like Elizabeth didn't deserve life because she was 50?",28
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I found the ending disappointing. I was stoked when >!Sue was booked for the New Year’s show.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"After I saw the trailer I didn't want to see it, it looked like a bad B movie. But I ended up watching it. half-way through I felt it was so bad it was good and by the end I saw cult classic to be. It reminded me of a mix between the movie Looker (1981) and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Carrie (1976) (won't say why so I don't give spoilers away and a bit pressed for time). I think the movie is an omen to the rising vapid influencers and similar who are doing just about anything to beautiful and relevant. It was symbolic of how we have a fight we being authentic and yet having everything we think is valuable such as youth and beauty but those things don't last and are missing something deeper. In the end it points how we've lost the way and destroy ourselves to the point of being like a cancer that nobody wants. The thing is all present may condemn and yet they'd probably all be guilty of the same given the chance. The movie was over-the-top and is like the more viewable baby sister of ""The Human Centipede"" is gross factor.",9
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,Watched most of the third act through my fingers but I enjoyed it,10
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I thought it was very good commentary on body dysmorphia and addiction. I thought the film was very expertly crafted and kind of realistic in terms of how the world looks when you are dealing with those things. The way that half of the movie takes place in her bathroom, the way she always managed to keep it hidden, always closing the door just in time before anyone else can see her switch, etc just hit really hard. I was half expecting a plot twist that her original body was never really altering and this whole time she was just imagining herself like that. I actually kind of liked the ending though, or at least I can’t think of a more powerful way they could have ended it— it would have been too easy if she killed Sue and lived the rest of her life as a hermit, or if she would have killed herself which I think ironically would have been too happy of an ending. The way I interpreted it was that she could have maintained a balance between Sue and Elisabeth and it would have all been okay, but she didn’t have the willpower to do so because of how powerful the addiction and shame spiral was— she no longer cared about protecting her body, she just wanted to stay high on Sue until it destroyed her body to the point of no return. Her new lifestyle was unsustainable, and because of that she now had to live with the consequences. 

All else aside, it was also very campy and slay. Very very well shot and very good soundtrack. It was very uncomfortable to sit through in the sense that it shook me to my core. I don’t think I’ve been this disturbed by a horror movie in theaters in a long time.",8
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Yeah. Loved it. Was a vocal crowd but the finale stunned them into stiff silence. Made a video review because I wanted to talk about it. Will go again on general release for the crowd reactions. Edit: 3rd viewing was a hoot. People walked out. I clapped as people said ""who has a bathroom like that anyway"" and ""they ruined it"".

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I think it’s also a brilliant critic of hustle culture and corporate ladder climbing in general. Elisabeth is an example of the kind of person who sacrificed EVERYTHING for her career. She had no friends, no family, no hobbies, no life at all outside of her career and her image.

The ending looked like the director struggled mentally with something and is trying to spit it all out on everyone. Not much  originality and creativity in my opinion. 
Demi was amazing tho. She really carried that movie. Although it’s a bit hypocritical that they are trying to criticize the beauty standards of Hollywood and show how women struggle with aging yet hire an actress full of botox and plastic surgeries. Kinda makes the movie less reliable.",18
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I absolutely love this movie. It’s comedic, disturbing, cheesy and over the top in all of the best ways, and yet so relatable at the same time with themes of self criticism and self love. I also picked up on references to substance abuse - I don’t think that’s where the movie title came from or anything of the sort, that’d be too direct and obvious. I’m in recovery myself so maybe it’s just the way my brain works lol but the way she’d have to RUN to the bathroom to extract more time from/for herself (sort of like a “fix”) and to keep from getting sick reminded me of that, especially when she did it in order to be able to perform. 

I’m typically not one for mixing comedy and horror but this one did it perfectly; certain moments that would usually make me laugh actually made me uncomfortable and I just sat there with my hand over my mouth like “what. the. fuck.” Some parts did make me laugh though which was clearly the intention. 

Demi’s performance in this is absolutely unreal. I don’t remember her being that good?? The cooking scene while she’s watching the interview is gorgeously disgusting, infuriating and hilarious. I forgot for a minute that I WASN’T watching Jessica Lange in AHS. I started to really feel for her as the movie progressed and she began to hate both (all?) versions of herself more and more. I think a lot of people can relate to the mirror makeup scene, followed by what I interpreted as a depressive episode with isolating, ditching plans, not taking care of yourself; in other scenes also the overeating, increasingly negative self talk, LOT of mental health and external/internal validation themes. When Elisabeth and Sue started treating each other like shit, saying really terrible things and literally fighting “each other” (fighting herself), I was like “well that’s not very good positive self talk.” And the bells went off when I realized it’s not far off from how I sometimes talk to myself. Gotta work on that. 

With all of that being said, I watched this and I Saw The TV Glow back to back, and have since decided to no longer consume any media and to increase my therapy sessions to twice a week.",5

By the end, the theatre was full of people laughing and squirming.  I haven't stopped thinking about it.  This film hits it out of the park, whether it's a foul ball or not is going to be a matter of taste.  I found every single scene and every single shot to be remarkably assured and surreal, like a writer who never wastes a single word, or a choreographer who focusses as much on small finger movements as broad steps.  I am very open to rich critiques of this film, but in terms of auteur prowess, this is an 11/10.  If you can stomach body horror and like good films, you absolutely must see this movie.",3
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"It's a bit Picture of Dorian Grey (living life while the thing in the back room pays for it), a bit Jekyll and Hyde, with a very modern theme of aging-out in Hollywood - specifically for females. Throw in some Cronenbergian body-horror and a style reminiscent of Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream for good measure.

Bravo to the filmmaker and the actors - they really put themselves out there. You're going to feel something by the end of the movie, which isn't something I can say about most horror films.

For all the over-the-top sexuality and gore, this is an extremely sad movie. Trigger warning for more sensitive viewers, but I think this is what the horror genre needs.",3

At first I thought Elizabeth experiences, or sees through Sue's eyes in the 7 days Sue is active. But I came to realize they're just two different people..

So what is the point of the substance? To make a younger version of yourself, but it's not actually a younger you, a whole new person who kinda looks like you. Then they get to get live their life and feed off you.

How does it benifit the main person? They don't get to feel that young feeling or go out and have fun.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I know this post is older, but you said you wanted to discuss so here's my two cents from watching it tonight:

Fantastic cinematography and sound design hindered by a derivative plot. It felt like it was trying to do what black Swan did, except the themes of anorexia and ocd are replaced by themes of aging and, well, Hollywood. I really enjoyed the body horror segments but couldn't really get behind the pathos, especially considering how it felt like a more shallow version of Black Swan.

In my showing the film was preceeded by a trailer for A Different Man starring Adam Pearson, an actor with elefantitis. This kept playing in my mind during the final scene and what was supposed to portay a physical representation of the pain of Moore's character felt like a mockery. Perhaps this was a case of bad timing or perhaps it said something about us as an audience. I found this quite fascinating and it made me question my own prejudices in a way that was definitely not intended.

Ultimately,  I wanted to like it but I didn't. Visually, it did everything right, but the substance just wasn't there, no pun intended.",8

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"You know what, I enjoyed it. I went in almost blind, and I think that’s better. I think it’s a movie you should go watch in the cinema because it won’t be the same on a monitor. It’s not the best thing ever, but it’s really good. Bodily error (very bodily in several ways). Maybe too on the nose with certain themes, but still has messages to convey, even if they’re nothing new.

But more than that, every frame had a beautiful color palette. Not like every frame is pretty or some kind of contest-level photography. There are lots of ugly and gross things, but even those had a really good color arrangement, matching in different ways, eye candy in a LOT of senses. The ending is loud, in several ways too, lol.

You could blame Sue as technically it was all her fault, she disregarded the rules and starting fucking shit up first, being a little time/energy thief. But then you could blame Elisabeth for thinking jabbing herself with a weird drug was a good idea, and not to consider that if she hates herself, then her “perfect, better version of you” would probably also hate her. Regardless, when Sue killed Elisabeth I was fuming, and was absolutely delighted when the little bitch started falling to bits. I think I was supposed to empathise with her, but I never really did.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I honestly thought it was quite a poor film. Yes, I get the undertones of Hollywood - American culture in general - always wanting younger and prettier 'next big thing', but who doesn't know that? We all know that when a woman reaches a certain age, the establishment (across the board, not just Hollywood) ousts them and brings in someone younger (why do you think that news anchors all look like plastic-skinned androids?). We know this! This film isn't anything deep or meaningful, or saying something that hasn't been highlighted a million times before... Is that the selling point of this movie and what it is hinging on? And, of course in today's world, the males are the biggest, most disgusting and most evil caricatures of a real person. Do you not think that this narrative is getting old? Planting seeds in young peoples' minds that all men are 'evil' is not healthy and leads to a confused outlook on life, based on a half-truth and today's narrative. That is not a good thing.

Back to the culture: young woman feel the pressure of an impossible perfection - again mainly thanks to America  -  but is it not a tad self-obsessed and childish, as an adult, to still be hung up on 'being young'?
Plastic surgery is horrific in of itself - weird looking, moulded cat people - and if that is a theme, then it should have pointed in that direction. If anything, the underlying story should be about the evils of going under the knife and the mindset that brought a person to that point, with the protagonist realising that they are their own version of perfect, just as themselves. 

Now for the movie itself: the story was nonsense. It couldn't stick to its own narrative and if anything, Sue was an entirely different person from Liz, like they weren't at all connected. It didn't make sense. Then, Sue wanting to abuse then kill her old self - 'the Matrix' - surely knowing that if she does, she'll also die. Surely she knew that. It's stupid. Was it a commentary or a gross-out slapstick comedy? It was all over the place.

The third act. Jebus wept. Talk about being out-of-place. Where did that come from? The gore was more extreme than a b-movie classic, but again, stupid (how much blood does a person have?). Was the film wanting us to think about the 'themes' or be grossed-out? Sad or enjoying the gore? Look for meaning or switch-off?

Just my rant.",2

But I suppose todays' bubble culture - 'you're 100% with me or your an enemy' mindset - is hard to excape from and the 'themes' are more important than reality.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"As a man in the healthcare and beauty industry: I just watched it,  didn't feel grossed out but rather more sympathetic to young and older women out here. Even the men. Also shows the egotistical women nowadays. I'm an open-minded, young gentleman. Nothing like the creepy seafood french cuisine lunatics we have running the fashion and beauty industry. You're all beautiful in your own way. 
Beauty treatments are to enhance your self image, not change it to the point that now, you're another person. It can backfire with the psychological aspect, where one can end up hating their old self, become addicted to the newer, more youthful self. We all want to be loved and appreciated by others. 

Now for the women nowadays. This term feminism is not understood by majority of women today. Creepy men are hated by gentlemen and women. Anyway, feminism has made women egotistical. They think their beauty can run the show, but in fact it's the same fitness routine. She got the job, never changed her routine yet no one noticed and preferred the young woman except the one weird nerdy guy that always liked her the way she is. Apart from the one man,   the legacy of old Elizabeth disappeared in an instant. All spoken out of hatred, by her newer self, Sue. 
My warning to all, especially extreme feminists. Respect the gentlemen, don't put them down just because they're not model looking. Oh he's 6ft, that's perfect. Shorter, ignore him and let him suffer. Oh, he's not got a great face, ewww let him suffer. So, this mentality creates more evil men, joining the shareholders group and they'll profit from your beauty and you'll turn into puppets instead. Don't become a monsto and end up looking like a mess. Respect great men. Respect great women. We all have our flaws, don't focus too much and live your life. Elizabeth was never in a relationship, Sue was abusing her looks to get the natural tall, model men. For fun. Yet it's only those men unfortunately portrayed as only caring for sex. Not everyone revs the pedal and fuels their ego,  pictured as the male Sue of today. 

Men don't put make up or utilise certain beauty treatments. Nothing wrong with beauty treatments, it's a tool to enhance, not to change.  What we do as men, is accept our heights, good 6ft or not so good (judged by both Elizabeth and Sue's of the world), accept our male genetics despite all the negativity from women like Sue and Elizabeth. Both are one. Men are put down constantly. 
So this film in my perspective, is fuelling bad feminism and once again, not realising all the actual hard work us guys have to put up with. Financially lacking, no woman wants you. No height, women (even the short women apparantly deserve the height difference lol) hate you. No muscles, skinny,  again no woman wants you. But for men outside of the film industry, we all appreciate you, young or old. Its preferences and being open minded. If you find it ewww, don't tell them they're eww, it's soul destroying. 
Don't be that old man following Elizabeth, embrace your beauty. Beauty you can't change. We can lose weight, remove wrinkles under our eyes, put make-up on to enhance, apply creams to enhance your youthful skin and maintain them. But you can't change genetics. Height is the  one thing we can't change. Sue was called little or small, can't recollect. But the creepy seafood CEO called her small, despite her being the same height as him. Sue playing with her looks so the neighbour doesn't complain, again something weak men fall for. 

So, don't be Elizabeth and Sue, in personality. Also, don't be too crazy that you see yourself as unlovable. That goes for men as well. I just found out that the woman behind this fantastic film, is a feminist. This shows, and i need to address this as no one pointed this out and saw it in her viewpoint. No one wants to acknowledge the point of view of open minded men like myself who understand this, although i love seafood...

The pressure of self-harm, self-loathing, need, etc. just obliterating on stage and dousing the audience that created this monster (words from Harvey of ""creating"" perfection) was deeply symbolic because itcentered on Elisabeth/Sue's own doing in response to the vicious cycle, and the director hyper-focused on that.",12

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"See id argue here that first it’s not the undertone of the film (youth obsessed Hollywood, going under the knife) but that’s the overtone. This is a film about the female experience from youth to motherhood, ageism, and beyond. It’s about loving yourself and hating yourself. And the destruction that comes from the latter.

I’d also say it’s not an ‘all men are evil’ film, but it does point out the obvious inequalities that still exist for women in any walk of life that don’t for men. A systematic issue that still exists whether we like it or not and is proven widely (ahem gender pay gaps).

This is a film about the experience of women. Granted not all women. But many of us. 

From medical neglect, impossible beauty standards, and misogyny. 

The film is crass, gory and ridiculous yes. It’s got B movie vibes (that i personally loved). 

For me it told a bizarre-but truthful story of what it’s like to be a woman. It’s bloody, scary, complicated, competitive and sometimes fucking depressing (especially when someone tells you to smile more cos you’re pretty). 

I’m glad this has never been an experience you can relate to. Unfortunately, I could relate. And for that reason I found it a powerful movie.",4

Storytelling is a skill, just like playing Dayz. The more you do it, the more you recognize techniques and strategies. So if you were to watch some pro streamer play Dayz, you could probably explain to me why they did certain things, what they were hoping to accomplish, etc.

The substance was advertised as a product that would allow its user to become a younger ""better"" version of themselves. Elisabeth made sue who has the appearance of a young teenager but sue made monstro and what is younger than a teenager, a child, a lthough not physically a child, she is mentally a child. She is basically the child of sue and the grandchild of elisabeth, who wishes to carry out their dream to be on stage. A child however doesn grasp the concept of beauty or ugliness, thats why she is able to prep herself before going on stage without looking disgusted and shamlessly drag herself on that stage.

I could just imagine a patient coming home from work one day to discover their family Rottweiler has gotten loose and mangled your own body.  There's enough risks to go wrong within the Substance alone, then add to that all that could wrong outside of it.

And then, the cavities. Would you still have to brush and floss your other body every day? They're still alive and would still succumb to bad breath germs. It's a hell a lot of work just to have 7 consecutive days of being hot at a time. I'll stick with face creams.",34

The studio to me seemed to represent the film industry, with ""Harvey"" the boss being a direct reference to an abusive, male Hollywood executive. When Elisabeth goes to use the women's toilet, it's ""Out of Order"", so she's forced to use the men's.


I wondered if this was some kind of comment by Fargeat that, as a female ""horror"" director - especially an auteur - she can't avoid being compared to iconic male directors and can't avoid using the tools and tropes that they established. There simply aren't enough female auteurs - especially in horror - to draw from. In order to reach the spotlight, she's forced to walk a path laden with the work of older, male directors.


To me it felt like Fargeat was very deliberately referencing male horror auteurs in this film, partly to pay homage and partly, in a film about how the patriarchy dominates the entertainment industry, to say ""Look, I'm forced to use these tropes established by men, but I'm going to use them, and subvert them, to convey women's experiences of that world.


Sorry I'm not articulating that well. I guess it's like saying that Fargeat celebrates and feels trapped by the male horror auteurs who came before her.",6

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,I felt a lot of requiem for a dream while watching. especially when they intensified the squishes and sounds of a scene like when she was injecting the stabilizer. the end was just completely original chaos lol,1
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Well yeah, because it's still not publicly known, or legal. We were discussing a world where it's normalized to at least some degree.


And I doubt she cleans her mess with the eggs and newspapers all by herself. ",1
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I've read this multiple times and I think that's exactly what it is. It makes sense in the context of the movie. The first number of times she's more in control of sue but the longer she uses the substance the more addicted and deranged she gets when 'on' the substance.

I also really like the termination scene. It's her really getting rid of the addiction, but even then she just can't. I feel like I've seen or at least can imagine say an alcoholic pouring alcohol down the drain and immediately regretting it and trying to salvage what's left.",16
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Yup!! This was my main takeway too. Not specifically Hollywood substance abuse, but addiction in general. There’s a few scenes like the phone pinging with texts like “are you ok” and demi moore banging her head on the wall saying “stop, stop” that probably ring a bit too true for a lot of people. 

And just the whole concept of stealing time and physical health from yourself. Putting on a facade that everything is fine, when you’re literally killing yourself. Binge eating and blocking out the windows. If you know, you know. Glad I’m not there anymore, but damn. It’s called The Substance for a reason. It’s Substance abuse.",5
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"You articulated it very well! 

I think at the very least that you’re correct in identifying commentary on the industry. And that there’s a reason she has to use the men’s bathroom. The safest interpretation of that is simply that it highlights the industry’s lack of support for women and the emphasis on men. 

But I think there’s definitely something to what you’re saying about having to “act” to appeal to the male gaze. Not just physically the way Sue does but on the meta level, as well. The Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch references are almost the same thing as Sue lol. 

There’s definitely conversation to have there, whether it’s intentional or through the “death of the author” view that intentionality doesn’t matter.

If it helps, I had a theory that the city design in Transformers One had skyscrapers on the ground and on the ceiling because it created a mirror-like division in the city that visually embodied the division between Optimus and Megatron and thus the autobots and decepticons. 

Ended up asking the production designer about it and he said that was actually the intention.

So I think you’re definitely on to something.",4
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Even if it wasn’t the director’s theme, torture porn elements are all over the place in this movie. We watch her sew herself up for extended periods. The needle sequences, the 3 min plus paint it red scene although campy is A LOT. The tainted sounds to make even normal things on screen gross and uncomfortable. I found this a tougher watch than say any Saw movie. I was struggling with the sound mixing. The sounds were brutal. Idk, the fight between Sue and Liz was incredibly vile. That was some I saw the devil shit.",3

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Yup. It’s my main takeaway too. The diminishing returns, loss of control, and desperation. The internal battle between yourself and yourself. Recklessly fucking yourself over, avoiding the fact that it’s all gonna come crashing down. 

It really resonated with me, as someone who has been there before. There’s a bunch of subtle nods to this theme that are just too real - bailing on plans, watching your phone ping w texts like “are you okay,” the specific set decoration that captures what a place looks like after a bender. Laying in the shower begging yourself to stop. Believing that as long as you keep things in balance, everything will be fine. But slowly violating that balance more and more until you’re just a pile of slop on the sidewalk",3

>!So what I didn't get was what Elisabeth benefits from the substance - which is kinda the whole plot.!<

>!I know that the Voice-On-The-Phone-Guy keeps insisting that they're ""one"".  When the split first happened, I assumed that that was Elisabeth in Sue's body, like they were ""one"" person in two bodies.  But Sue seems to have a different consciousness.  Elisabeth is surprised by all the things Sue is saying in the interview, which means she has no memory of being in Sue...which means they're two separate entities.  Maybe Sue came from Elisabeth, but they have different thoughts, memories, agendas. So why would someone do this if they got no benefit out of it? It's not like Elisabeth is reliving her glory days - she's just asleep for 7 days....!<",50

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"Great movie. My take is that it is meant to view the transformation as a metaphore for cosmetic surgery - creating a split personality - one that is adored for their beauty and youth, people starting to treat you differently than before (lookism). And then there is another one, the old one, knowing that it is still same person behind the facade, with some of the same problems than before, eating disorders, realising that the new look is not all-transformative, even starting to hate the new person for being fake, fearing for the future look as the aging is inevitable. And when another cosmetic surgery (another transformation) is needed, the visual outcome may not be a desired one and there are only hints of the original person left, the rest is just a mess of flesh, out of proportion, out of place even. It could be a superficial take, but this is what resonated with me some time after viewing the film. So in essence, it is a message of warning.",4

I don’t understand her motivation, though.
I get it, if she would exist in both bodies, sharing one brain/ memory, and just switched between them. That way, she could relive her youth, which makes sense.
But in this case, she’s basically creating a separate person with the same DNA but a different identity, then going to sleep while that person lives their best life without sharing it with her.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"ive only rly seen overwhelmingly positive reviews so here’s my honest semi positive semi negative thoughts. i thought it was really unique and i loved the concept and most of the movie! however i found it really weird and ironic (since it is a movie making a point about hollywood only caring about the young fresh new meat and casting aside older actresses) to make their nudity scenes so fking long like okay we get it Sue is young and hot and Elisabeth is old and worn out let’s move on now (not saying nudity is bad and i understand why we had to see the younger body to compare it to the older one it just felt uncomfortably long). aside from the nudity scenes, a lot of scenes were far too long and should have been cut significantly shorter. the extra pan ins and close ups felt very male gazey. the ending could have been way shorter and also why do they hammer it into our heads that they’re both one/the same person but it really felt like neither had any control over what the other was doing? on top of that, Elisabeth Sparkle kept doing things to fuck over Sue, over eating, ruining the apartment etc but Sue was never physically impacted by the choices Elisabeth made? When Sue was out for longer than 7 days it made Elisabeth older, but when Elisabeth binge ate and lazed around it didn’t impact Sue. I also feel they could have made some things a bit more subtle, sometimes it felt like they thought the audience is just stupid so they had to hammer points in but some subtlety could have made it so much better.

So, my take was that it's still her - Sue has all Elisabeth's memories, but at the point of Sue's creation, Elisabeth's reality diverged into 2 different paths. The original Elisabeth will stay in her old body, but the duplicate of her gets a do-over. So in a way, she is still experiencing her new better reality. If she werent so vain at her core, they would have been able to exist in balance.

But as the other substance customer lamented; the 'better' version ultimately gets greedy, because it was vanity in the first place that lead them to take the substance",75
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"I think the idea that they were two different people at the end is one of the broader concepts the film was trying to illustrate. We idealize the younger, fitter and more beautiful version of ourselves to the point where it feels like “they” are totally separate from who we are now. Like our whole sense of identity and self worth, especially for women in the entertainment industry, is intrinsically linked to our looks and fitting the beauty standard (which is upheld by the patriarchy). 

Fighting to stop time, molding our physical bodies into what society deems acceptable through painful procedures, eating disorders, and other forms of torture, creates a massive internal conflict- Elisabeth was essentially at war with herself. 

But we are one. we are still the same person now. To preserve purity, innocence, and youth, you symbolically, and sometimes literally, destroy the version of yourself which has aged and has gained wisdom, experience, and resilience as a result.",39

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"I might be way off the mark but I saw this whole split consciousness aspect as reminiscent of addiction, which a lot of people experience when it comes to extreme beauty procedures. When you’re struggling with addiction, you’re the same person, but you have to deal with all the chaos of the “other” you and what you take from yourself, the behaviours you engage in, etc. even if they’re massively detrimental to you in the long run.",13
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,I struggled with this as well. It’s not like Elizabeth can “live” through Sue. But the substance narrator keeps reminding her (and us) that they ARE one. And I think seeing Sue’s success both makes her feel like it’s her success but eats away at her (quite literally at times) at the same time. Such an amazing film 😭,11
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"Elizabeth was seeing only downsides to it, but when she wanted to terminate, she couldn't do it as she felt like even though she was being ""eaten away"" by Sues choices, Sue being her, and having youth and beauty was the only thing she/they had to offer and thus has to keep sue alive as she didn't feel that she had anything else worth giving.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"So the take away that I got was she was a selfish person whod do anything and step on anyone to accomplish her goals. 

Even tho she created a copy it was an exact copy of her. I'm guessing someone that's willing to take a Substance just to relive their youth would be just as reckless as a younger form ot themselves or worse as it turned out. They were the same mind, just 2 separate bodies.

All she did was create a carbon copy of her selfish self but younger, better looking, and with a younger, more devil, may care attitude. When the New Year's opportunity came up, it was what she always dreamed, so she was gonna have it come hell or high water. It was her ultimate dream.

Instead of just accepting that we all get older and when our younger year's are behind it and our curtain comes closer to being drawn she got given an option. She didn't follow the rules and well the film shows u when someone with a narcissistic individual who displays sociopathic tendencies. Though ironically, she was not the best candidate.

The grass always looks greener but very seldom is.",2

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"Well, they say that taste is subjective, my friend, and not having seen the film yet I can't really weigh in with my opinion. You are correct tho a lot of people are holding this film in high regard and one of my first thoughts wen I saw the trailer was is this gonna be another case of style over substance (pun intended :)

Ahh so wot your saying is they keep hammering home the same theme 🤔 or message because and again I'm just assuming here a women who wants to recapture her fading beauty makes a deal with devil and takes some supplement finds herself needing more to keep up with the beautification facade and then finds herself turning into a monster only realising by the time her body has started to degenerate she was in too deep?

Again, this is all guesswork on my part, but it seems a logical conclusion to the trailer and the way the film looked like it could play out.

What message do u mean, mate?  Multiple pilot points being hammered home? And what about the plot did you find interesting?

And I don't mind spoilers if you would like to give me a brief synopsis or your review of the fillm and plot. Its been out for a bit now, so I'm bound to go somewhere on the Internet and have someone tell me or one of my international friends telll me so yeah I'd love to hear what u think in more detail my friend 😊",1
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"I think the messages are themselves are good, and some aspects of them told very well. I also think it was a creative perspective, and its use of body horror to be provocative but appropriate. I wouldn't throw out the whole movie, but I totally agree with you that them showing every plot point multiple times *did* take away from the movie. I literally had a moment to myself where I thought, ""Fuck, is every movie going to do this shit from now on? Hit the audience over the head with the same shit multiple times because most viewers are so distracted they'll miss even the most obvious messages?""

In other words, I agree, but I guess it didn't completely ruin the movie for me.",1
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"The other film as someone else pointed out is a film called Revenge its pretty graphic and there are some highly unpleasant scenes obviously I don't wanna spoil it but I know some people get uncomfortable watching some things so just thought I'd warn ya. I really enjoyed the film, and you can massively get behind the main protagonist who's female.

Yeah I know wot ya mean I turned 40 this year and I've got greys in me hair, me beard, nose hair lol haven't got any ear hair yet tho I think I might legit cry when that happens.

I'm quite vain , but I wouldn't say I'm a hottie either probably 4.5/5/10 on the looks front throw my personality into the mix, tho I make it to a 7 I reckon.

I think, like u said, if done well, this film can play on all of our insecurities as its human nature to want more and further seek self-improvement and even perfection (another good film, btw) dare I say it so I'm hoping simple story she takes the formula to seek perfection and then it starts playing havok on her older body so she uses it more and so on and so forth.

I wouldn't say u tripped too hard it just means you were paying a lot more attention to the surrounding aesthetics than I was. 

I spose there's plot holes in every film if u look hard enough. I thought the film on a whole where you've got Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid plus Sue whoever she's played by it came off as an indie film with that Hollywood polish which I don't normally like I like my indie films to stay indie but I rather enjoyed this film I think Dennis and Demi were fantastic in their roles Sue well she didn't have that much dialogue and she kinda felt she was only there for the obvious reason which was to look like a younger hotter version of Demi Moore so job done. Although her chasing Elizabeth down the hallway and goin full on super roid rage was pretty kool.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"See I took it to have a different meaning. The meaning I got from this film was society in general values youth and beauty in females much more than age and wisdom. The tv execs, film execs are always looking for the younger more bankable female rather than one who's like you said sacrificed and put in the years only then to be put out to pasture.

Another poster made a brilliant analysis on cosmetic surgery and the substance and again looking to continue to drain that fountain of youth long after its run dry. 

I saw Elizabeth as a self centred, narcissistic individual who's only reason for living was herself and her dreams and when she didn't achieve them she saw the cheat code and grabbed it. But unfortunately the old saying cheaters never prosper came back to haunt her.

The fact that the video and voice kept saying you are one interested me because I thought ironically the substance seemed a lot to me like power it should never be given to people who seek and and those willing to say no would probably have more of the mindset to use the substance properly but maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe the substance is always doomed for failure regardless of who takes it because its hardcoded in most of humanity to be selfish and take more than what's needed especially when it's offered on a platter.

I like your analysis too tho. That's why I love films like this. They can mean so many different things to people and none of them are wrong if thought throught critically enough.

The only dracula based film I've seen in the past couple of years that was good was Voyage of the Demeter. I really enjoyed that. I'll definitely put Nosferatu on the list. My most anticipated horrors of the year have got to be this Substance and Longlegs.

I keep hoping they make one final scream film and bring Matthew back to play Stu as the killer to tie everything up they could even call it final scream I'm not a scriptwriter but I came up with a pretty good idea for how they could do it even in the last film they show the tv and kirby says yeah his body was never found and he's the only killer who was never definitively shown as dead so they've left the breadcrumbs to do it. All it needs is a good story and someone to pull the trigger.

Can u imagine if, in the final scene, Ghost face removed his mask, and it showed Stus face all scarred up from the tv and said surprise Sidney?

I was always that kid. If u told me to do something, I'd do the complete opposite 😆 🤣 and I'm 40 now, and I haven't changed and don't plan on starting yet. I do believe as a society we are all far too obsessed with beauty and pretty people when in actuality some of the most attractive people I've met have turned out to be some of the most boring people I ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Whether there's a correlation between highly attractive people say not having to work as hard as the rest of us I dunno but it's a sound theory. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that every attractive person has the personality of a goldfish but some of the most amazing people I've ever met certainly weren't 8's or 9's in the beauty department lol 😆 

It's kinda like the analogy of rich people never having to have worked for anything and always being given everything so easily. Imo the struggle is what builds character and manners too I might add again some of the wealthiest people I've met have turned out to be rude and obnoxious where as people from poorer backgrounds who have had to scratch and claw for everything they've earned have turned out to be some of the nicest, kindest most caring and interesting people I've come across.

My favourite 2 parts are where >!firstly, she takes the peyote and beer can and patches herself back up. Yeah, it's a bit far-fetched surviving the fall, etc, but looking for a deeper meaning I took the cave to represent possibly that she hadn't survived and that was her descent into the inferno especially with the fire etc. But then waking up with the brand, the fact that her flesh now belonged to the devil, maybe I dunno its fun to ponder these things. Secondly, I like the scene where there both messed up at the end blood everywhere. Visibly against the tiles and floor, it's striking, but I don't know if when he slips if that was intentional, but it looked pretty real and glad they kept it in. I love what he does with the cling film or saran wrap for our us cousin's. Digging into that scene and how it plays out I interpreted it as she had to struggle so now it's his turn so that's why she takes her time with him and let's the fear build in him until its her time to strike and exact her Vengeance making her Revenge complete. Also, I've just thought of this and the 7 deadly sins analagy. I dont know if their all there, but wrath, pride, envy and sloth are definitely there im gonna have yo rewatch it now haha!<

Yea I spose when normal people use social media, they can post whatever views and opinions they have when it's famous people it's a whole different ball game especially if their working on a project because of the scope of people they can reach and I would assume the film companies want to stay apolitical especially when it comes to something so complex and devisive as Israel and Palestine.

Damn, that sucks. For me, that scene where Elisabeth (Demi Moore) is preparing for her date and grows frustrated and more hateful towards her own appearance and self was so earnest and devastating. I understand self-hate all too well, so I found her to be incredibly tragic. Actually, it might be good that you don’t relate xD

I think this movie is also similar to Evil Dead, in that it really works if you vibe with it. But that’s entirely subjective and up to the viewer’s individual taste. If you don’t, then you don’t. I did, so I had an absolutely great time. Very simple theme but great execution—loved the visuals, score, campy/outlandish style. It’s definitely strong on feel.",4

It really comes across as a film not written by a writer, but an actor, in that they thought ""Oh wow beauty standards bad"" and the film completely relies on that message. But you know the message going in and they don't do anything clever with it. To be fair, I thought it was bad going by the trailer, and it was.

Not even the gore felt scary. The characters were one-dimensional and almost clownish. The nudity was excessive, and despite being directed by a woman, the amounts of unnecesarry boobs felt like it was made by a horny man with zero creativity. Somehow it felt slow paced to me, even when they bombarded you with loud sounds and trippy scenes.

It almost made me feel like they thought the audience was too stupid to get the message so they had to cut to little flashbacks showing stuff (like the doctor's scar) or people repeating stuff for you to make the connection.

It's a maximalist satire film that does exactly what it intends to do, hold up a demented mirror to our society much like A Clockwork Orange, NETWORK, or The Holy Mountain (all of which this film reminded me of) or other exaggerated social satires of the 70s..


For me it's similar to the complaint people seem to not be articulating correctly which is that the movie doesn't have anything to ""say"" which really means they didn't like where it went or that it didn't wrap itself up in a nice neat bow or a happy ending (which is what my mom expressed frustruation with) and its like yeah? Why would it though?? Obviously these problems haven't been solved in real life so why do we put the pressure on art/entertainment to provide us the answers?

Thoughts on The Substance?,1727460081.0,"IMDB - 7.9

META - 77

You call a C+ overrated??? 

Nah, i think you simply didn't like the movie and would rather spend your time tearing something down, showing a lack of appreciation, and trying to convince others to do the same. C+ is a perfect score for this movie, and, I think, the hype is very much earned.",2
Thoughts on The Substance?,1727460081.0,"It was an 8 until very recently - it will continue to drop as less enthusiasts weigh in. That’s not a C+ either you dimwit - this isn’t grade school where half the class gets 100. Very few movies ever get a 100 on the meta and the highest ranked movie of all time is a Shawshank at 9.3 - this would be considered grading on a curve. 7 movies ever have a 9 or higher on IMDB, so an 8 is very high, not a C+",4

Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,"I find the discourse around this very interesting. I think this movie falls squarely into the Body Horror sub-genre, which itself often straddles the horror-comedy line. I think how funny you found The Substance is in the eye of the beholder, just like how most horror movies are scary to some and not to others. 

In any case, this is another good example of how painfully reductive the categories “Drama” and “Musical or Comedy” are.",16

Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,"This doesn't surprise me at all. The Substance made my GF and I laugh and squirm in equal measure.

Her other movie, Revenge, is also darkly funny. The scene where >!she Rambo's her wound (acquired from falling 50 feet onto a branch that impales her through the stomach) with a heated beer can and leaves a pheonix shaped scar!< is peak comedy.

I can't wait to see what she does next. As fas as I'm concerned, she's carrying the Cronenburg Crown (awarded for elevating gross, angry, hilarious B-movies to an art form) into the future, and I couldn't be happier.",56
Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,To be fair it is kind of a dark comedy. The 3rd act itself goes full on absurdist comedy during the climax.,5

I think this more of an issue with how broadly films are labelled at the Globes. They could expand ""Drama"" to ""Drama/Thriller"" at the least, so that it could be more inclusive to horror films.",22

Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,"I think there's just some snobbery going on where they don't want to give a horror film its flowers so they shoehorn it into the less ""important"" and/or ""serious"" categories. The Substance is neither a musical nor comedy. Yes there are some funny parts and there is satire. It's not a comedy. Nobody would ever refer to it as a comedy. The intention of the film is not comedy. And it's so far removed from musical it's not even worth pointing out that it's not a musical.

They did the exact same shit with The Bear. ""Oh, here's this thing everyone is talking about and enjoying but we don't respect it enough to give it one of the more prestigious awards so let's just throw the comedy awards at it and if anyone complains we can just say they didn't 'get' it!""

MAYBE, just maybe, we start outright creating the horror category for these awards ceremonies considering this genre has been so enduring, so beloved, and clearly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It's almost as if horror CAN be a vehicle for great cinema 🤔 imagine that!",18

I don't want to pontificate too much about the brilliant things this movie did, but one thing I will mention is the way it sets up the jokes visually.

As a particular example, I'm thinking of the scene >! in the studio bathroom where Sue gets the idea to use the activator!< which culminates in >! the title card introduction of Monstra Elisasue!<

I’m a long time horror fan and I just don’t pay attention to award shows because I know work I love will be snubbed time and time again (also a big animation fan which is basically in the same boat).

1. Right now, the Globes only have 2 options - drama or musical/comedy. I genuinely think Substance fits less into drama than it does comedy. In a perfect world, the Globes would expand the genres, but that’s not going to happen this year. So it has to pick one. 

2. Mubi chose to submit The Substance as a comedy. They chose it. Not the Globes. This is surely a strategic move as they probably think it’ll have a better chance at being nominated/winning. For example, instead of Demi going against award heavyweights like Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie, she’ll be up against a newcomer like Mikey Madison.

Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,"I think you’re right about the sub genres but horror movies in particular undoubtedly have so much slop more than any other genre for sure, but when you find a good one it’s really fucking good. I think the same can be said about metal fr. There’s a lot of really terrible metal out there more so than in other genres but the good stuff is really good.",-7

Demi Moore's 'The Substance' Enters Golden Globes As Musical/Comedy,1729609844.0,"Not that either of these have any SA but still.

Yeah just like if we flip the genders in the movie Big with Tom Hanks then it becomes a bit more problematic for society somehow. Same with the 90's movie Blank Check.",2
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"Had a similar takeaway for this film. 

As much as this film has elements of satire, dark comedy, and body horror, it’s also an incredibly sad story.",483
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,are you me? I just watched it too and this scene had me in tears. this and the later one where sue was kicking Elizabeth. the self hatred 😭,170
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,It works so well. You are just screaming at her to go on the date. We know she is extremely beautiful and he would be heavenstruck even if she went on the date in clown makeup but it's disheartening to see her feel like she isn't pretty enough.,547
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"That was one of the most upsetting scenes for me. I very much struggle with the way I look, and I've definitely had days where I've tried to make myself look 'pretty' or 'perfect' and I'm just entirely unable to see it and I end up a pile of depression just like Elisabeth.

I really wanted her to go on that date even though I knew she wouldn't because otherwise the movie would pretty much end there. If she could feel beautiful and go on a date with a man who considers her absolutely stunning, then she might be able to respect the balance more on Sue Days and we would never see Sue taking more time from Elisabeth, so Elisabeth wouldn't try to terminate and Sue wouldn't kill Elisabeth and thus break down physically causing her to take the Activator and birth Monstro ElisaSue.",83
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,Honestly the body dysmorphia portrayal and literally everything else made me more uncomfortable than the body horror did,73
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,I loved that moment. It completely captures her frustration and desperation of not being able to control her perception of herself both in the professional and physical sense. The movie is a great character study.,57
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"That scene, coupled with the one where she’s screaming at Sue to keep living because “she’s the only part of her worth loving (something along those lines” killed me. I’ve struggled with self esteem, body image, and eating disorders. This movie really took me by the shoulders and shook them the whole time",57
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"My wife started crying during this scene. This film is absolutely unparalleled. It's a masterpiece of the likes I have never seen before, and might well never see again. Revenge kicked ass, and The Substance kicks it's ass. With this director, we are in the presence of a rare talent.",104
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I love the way that scene bookended the subject of aging women in Hollywood. we get to see the external event at the studio, and then the private effect it has on her at home.",51
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"Excellent movie. I loved how they used colour throughout.. (i.e. her yellow coat the same colour as the egg yolks, etc)",50
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,The doorknob and her distorted reflection in it was a gut punch.,48
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,man im glad i went into this movie blind - what a great flick.  i haven't been this impressed in years.  it wasn't perfect but miles better than anything else out,31
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,It was very well done. I also loved the intentionally bad lighting and unflattering camera angles that were used when she was feeling insecure.,31
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"Absolutely.


When I saw her ""first"" going out look, I thought, damn, Demi looks like a million $. And then her uncertainty took over, and every next adjustment was worse than the previous one...


Ingenious movie.",27
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"i actually recently started HRT with shots, and the whole substance prep was eerily similar to some of the steps you take for at-home injections. The fact that they have to be done weekly, too.",23
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"So, I remember Demi Moore from stuff like GI Jane and a bunch of 1990s potboilers mostly, and Charlie's Angels. And I liked her, she had decent screen presence and all, but that was it.

But Jesus fuck was anybody else absolutely blown away that she had a performance like this to hand all that time?!? Have I been blind?!?!",22
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I went to see this in the theater on my 50th birthday with a bunch of other women. Afterward, we were somewhat speechless but discussed how we felt relieved to not have Elizabeth's feelings of inadequacy around our bodies. The fact that she internalized the value society places on women to be fuckable above all else, and that she could only conceive of being loved for her appearance, felt like a cautionary tale. 

That said, one of the pale horrors of aging as a woman is the inevitable invisibility. The scene with Elizabeth and the motorcycle guy felt sadly familiar.",44
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,Yes made me think of my insecurities,18
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,it won't happen (the oscars hate horror) but Demi Moore should really be in the conversation for Best Actress this year. the movie would not work nearly as well without her performance!,55
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"Exactly, that scene nailed what a lot of women experience. It was very familiar.",72
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"This is the part that my wife felt was most accurate, and also wound up being the most upsetting part of the movie for her. Good horror has a way of doing that with real anxieties.",11

The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,Yes it was way too relatable. It made me so uncomfortable and  I thought of all the countless times I would break down in tears when getting ready to go out and redoing my makeup and never looking good enough. All the self loathing and saying no to going out so that I can hide away inside and not have anyone look at me. I only recently got diagnosed with body dysmorphia last week by my psychiatrist so it all just hit very close to home that scene.,15
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,Honestly the whole movie was incredible. I really was so shocked at how well done it was.,8
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"It’s the best horror movie this year imo, and there was some solid competition . I’ve seen it 3 times already and i love every minute of it, instant classic",7
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"The self-annihilation in the pursuit of trying to attain a better version of oneself is caught so well in this film, but this scene is a masterpiece. Better than any monologue-screed scenes that often get oscar noms.

That scene is easily one of the most amazing in the last year of cinema.",7
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I agree with this, but out of curiosity, what are other examples of body dysmorphia portrayed on film? I can’t think of any off the top of my head.",6
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I like to think about my mind's alternate version where she goes on the date, has a great time, around date 3 she reveals her secret, and then this becomes a weird scifi/romcom.",5
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"i just watched it, and it was so disturbing to me. the scene with fred actually made me cry, ive done that too. it was so emotional to me. tbh, i dont get affected by horror movies often, but this affected me alot. i have body dysmorphia to some degree, and i had to constantley check in the mirror to see if i still look normal, because, in my case my body dysmorphia somehow thinks im deformed sometimes, and that i look different then in photos and the mirror. it is without any basis and started in very early childhood, i dont even know where it comes from, but, whoever the people where that worked on it, they definitley had someone around or knew someone who suffered from body dysmorphia.

i just wish she gone out with fred...and i wished she terminated it much much earlier and tbh i got so angry about sue for treating her this way when she depends on her - like how could she be so dumb and mess it up this badly ??, but i know its just a metaphor for self hatred and body dysmorphia. the movie was really good, but i kinda wish i didnt watch it because it definitley spoke to that disordered part of me and it was like my biggest fear. even the disfigurment, that out of control thing there, its just so scary",4
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I’ve found myself repeatedly coming back and thinking of this movie. Today I only watched it the second time (mostly to have someone else experience it with me. Each scene in this movie has a point to get across, or message. I do not like body horror (aside from the Fly previously) but this has quickly become one of my favorite horror movies of all times. It says so much about how older women are treated, how people are treated based off how they look (particularly the climax, which has multiple layers), insecurity, mental health.

Frankly there cannot possibly by a better horror movie this year.

I feel like the end is almost bittersweet, since she >!actually finally embraces herself!<.",3
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I know it won't happen, but I would love to see midnight screenings of The Substance from time to time so that more people can see it on the big screen. It really does deserve to be seen in that format, more than most other movies I've seen.",4
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"I don't have body dysmorophia or an ED, just bodily insecurities like the rest of us. 

The moment she goes back to the bathroom to look *after* she felt great and confident ... That hit me hard. Cannot count the number of times in my life where I spend an hour + in front of the mirror, get super excited about how my hair and make up are turning out, then get ready to head out but catch a glimpse in another reflective surface and I've somehow turned into a completely different, uglier person than I saw 5 minutes previous ... Ugh. Horrible horrible feeling. 

During that scene I kept saying ""Honey Nooooo!""",4
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,Agreed. The scene where she was getting ready to go out but kept going back to glow up and ended up not being able to leave the apartment hit hard.,3
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,This film is a body-horror masterpiece,3
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"
I watch a lot of body horror to process various things about my physical and mental health and this scene is precisely why The Substance is like one of the top 10 movies of all time for me.

I’ve been through the exact same “routine” with body dysmorphia many times and have been going through another rough cycle with it lately, so watching the scene made me feel oddly comforted — like my feelings are something other people can understand and relate to.",5
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,I loved the the first 2/3s of this one but I think they went a bit ham in the last part and it lost me with Gwar segments. I get what was going on but it was just too much and went on too long IMO and diminished what they had built in the first 2/3.,6
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,I really couldn't agree more. Wonderful scene in a wonderful film.,2

A very devestating film across the board, a top one of the year for me.",2

The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"Something I think is also worth mentioning is that while it could've been seen as a crass and sexist thing that Harvey gives her a cookbook without much thought, the fact that all Elisabeth does while she's awake is eat and stay inside and yet we never actually see Sue eat or drink anything, speaks to a bit of an eating disorder to maintain her body.",1

The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,I just saw it yesterday and cannot get over it. Best film of the year and maybe one of my all time favorites from here on out.,1

Society views women as less valuable as they get older. Regardless of a womens talent, capabilities, or expertise, younger looking women are often praised more in society. The movie really shed light on the pressure and value that society (especially in this time) places on women by how they look .",-1
The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,The first half of the movie was interesting and set up some neat mysterious sci-fi things. But then the 2nd half and the ending was just stupid and ruined the whole movie.,-1

The violence that ensued was the one part of the film I had to look away from. It was not only physically disturbing af but, as some who has grappled with self hatred (though not for the same societal reasons the main characters were) I saw myself kicking myself and slamming my own face into the mirror. I can only imagine how much more intense that scene was for someone who has ever hated themselves over not feeling like they live up to the beauty standards and the expectations of the straight male gaze.

I saw an interview with Fargeat where she kept using the word the violence to talk about those expectations and their self-destructive internalizations. I can’t imagine a more visceral depiction of that",24

The most disheartening part to me was that you can imagine a better future for her if she didn't cave into taking the substance.

The customer service rep that she calls isn't able to care, and the people they're targeting as their userbase would more than likely be those ""susceptible"" to ""overuse"". But a question I have to ask, is wouldn't this be one of the most traumatic and also life-changing (in a positive way) event in one's life?

Could having to hide your aged body and literally stab yourself with a needle not provoke a bit of oddness? Do you think you could do any better if you were told that you're a singular person while existing in two bodies (non-simultaneously) and having to go from ""genetic perfection"" to your old less-than-perfect body? Not a judgment question but one I asked myself, would I if I didn't know the consequences of such a treatment if misused even attempt it? What if I knew?

Edit: I do want to say that I loved the messaging, and loved it for its unique screenplay - I am a massive horror fan but body horror is my least favorite horror. I can generally handle gore but teeth, fingernails and eyeballs are my big ""I cannot"" and the film hit all three. 

Perhaps the grossest body horror film since Dead Alive.",112

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,SAME. Thank you for asking this 😭,17
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I almost vomited multiple times and I am usually ok with gore.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I’m glad you asked this, it sounds like it’s really not an option for those of us who can’t handle gore! I might just read the plot instead.",15
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"
To your question, it’s a very easy-ish/linear plot to follow even if you self-censor the bonkers bits, but this movie WANTS to make you cringe.

More than a straight horror, thriller or even creature feature Substance is aiming and FULLY hits the BODY horror spooky-ookies bullseye.

TL:DR- like a legit rollercoaster you can close your eyes and enjoy the ride but just like any good rollercoaster if you open your eyes at the scariest bits  you’ll be treated to incredible madness that will make surviving the experience all the more fun and exciting in retrospect.",12
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I absolutely HATE gore and scary movies in general so while the trailers were playing before this movie started, I strongly considered leaving lmao I was nervous. However, I basically closed my eyes throughout the gory parts (you can definitely tell when it’s going to happen), and still enjoyed the movie LOL. I did get glimpses here and there but nothing that’ll keep me up at night for sure cause it was so whacky looking (as in, unrealistically possible) and just a few seconds long before I looked away.",11
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I hate body horror, I will wait for the Wikipedia summary 🙈",23
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I am the same. I closed my eyes/covered my face for 25-30% of the movie and I have no regrets. I saw it in the theater. If you think you have a tolerance level where that would work, you could watch it at home later. I think it depends on your level, re: gore. The film gives you pretty fair warning when something grotesque is coming, for the most part (there were a few specifically harrowing scenes where you knew what was coming and I just covered my face for like... a full minute. Because NOPE). THAT said: the sound design is, uh, very good so if it's not just visual for you, yeah skip. 

For me, I'm glad I saw it because I really liked the story/writing/themes and performances. There's SO much rich material in it and things to talk about. I also found it really sad, and kind of beautiful in a weird way? I cried at one bit, which is not something I do w/ horror.",10
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Nope don’t watch it if you don’t have the stomach for it. I’ve made the mistake of watching it after my edibles kicked in. Got through about 3/4 of the movie and threw up 😂,9
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I hate gore and i covered my eyes A LOT in this movie. There’s a lot of blood and guts and fluids involved,6

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,There are different kinds of gore. This is more body horror gore and needle gore than bloody gore though there is also bloody gore. Just not as much as I think the word usually suggests to me. I'm sure that wasn't terribly helpful but I can't say more without starting to spoil the movie.,5
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Honestly, based on peoples reactions, I thought that the gore would be worse. I do not like gore at all, but apparently, the 80s style of trash horror that my cousins kept showing to me when we were kids desensitized me enough lol. I refocused on something suddenly interesting on my phone a couple of times, and that was it",7
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"it's more gross than gory, if that makes sense?

if you're squeamish i might hold off for now. it's probably my favorite movie of the year but i definitely find it hard to recommend to people for that reason lol.",3

I left the movie like giggling and in awe rather than terrified,2
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I watched it because I heard so many good things about it but I hate gore in movies.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I was utterly horrified by the third act of this film. The first two were quite graphic but not necessarily gory. The third part though is very gory. One of Raffertie’s tracks for the soundtrack is called Blood and the following is More Blood. I would wait for streaming then you can pause it.,2
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"This is a specific benchmark but since we're all trying to gauge our tolerance lol I'm wondering if there's anyone here who has seen Fargeat's other film *Revenge*, and can say how the level of gore compares??

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I am usually pretty okay with horror generally but don’t have much experience with body horror.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Inspo is definitely from 80s horror movies - directors like Yunza, Henenlotter, Gordon.",7
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Okay so, respectfully, you’re missing the mark. I would argue, if anything, like countless horrors before, it is using *aging* as the horror element. You know, old people creepy and scary? However, given the theme of the film, it doesn’t seem mean spirited or even like a trope. My interpretation is that, in our youth we fear and resent aging, but as we age we fear the youth overshadowing us, we fear being forgotten and dismissed since we’ve lost our “light” and youthful appearance. This film is pretty in your face about those two selves sharing the same “being” and fighting for control. It’s not very subtle about “aging actress finds way to turn back the clock” - >! long story short they are one and can *not* be separated !< - what you’re seeing is not some reference to burn victims but a freakin lovecraftian nightmare of melded flesh. >! A literal boob plops out of her eye hole at some point for god sake lol. !<",3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,That’s an incredible reach for someone who clearly hasn’t seen the full costume. In no way is it intended to resemble a burn victim - it is essentially an homage to the half-mutated corpses from The Thing.,5
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I will say that if you look at the full prosthetic design, there are multiple faces/partial faces/facial features and multiple spines- so while this part of the photo does somewhat resemble a severe burn survivor, the larger picture is more like what would happen if multiple beings were fused together or multiple skeletons were growing beneath one skin— it seems more inspired by an unrealistically extreme version of a teratoma. Burn survivors don’t grow extra eyes, nostrils, breasts, or teeth.",7
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I think it’s just supposed to be a globby mutation of two human beings. The substance explicitly says it’s made for one time use, and if you disobey that rule as she does, it just turns your body into a fucked up malformed hybrid of your two selves.",3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"You're kinda not wrong. This movie tried to be really progressive but didn't really have anything interesting to say about women and how they're treated for aging, and reverted to having a big part of the body horror be a woman getting older and more decrepit. So feminist /s

It reminded me of X, which thought itself so progressive when in reality its ""horror"" was old women having a sex drive",-1

[POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER] There’s a lot of gross shit with food, closeups of disgusting food and people eating it sloppily with nasty sound effects — there’s also scenes that made me wince involving needles, teeth and fingernails that honestly grossed me out way more than the actual body horror. I saw it with a full cinema and people were VERY vocal in their horrified reactions lol, it was fun.

Still worth seeing at least once, but if you’re easily disgusted by the things I listed, you’re probably gonna feel kind of sick at some points.",20

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I usually wait until a month or so after something hits streamers to start posting unmarked spoilers.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,It is pretty gory. I found most of it okay because it was surreal but there were a few realistic things that were horrific for me. Like Dennis Quade eating shrimp.,130
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Thanks! I’ll sit this one out. 🤣,44
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Is it gore specifically or is it body horror generally?,16

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Those people are being hyperbolic for the purpose of making a point: the shrimp scene is just Dennis Quaid devouring a bunch of shrimp while in close-up with a wide-angle lens. He plays a gross Weinstein-esque studio executive and is telling Demi Moore that her value as a woman has effectively expired. If you are squeamish about body horror and gore it wouldn’t even rank in the top five list of grossest things you see in the film.,8

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,It's a very close up scene on Dennis Quaid's character sucking on shrimp/biting their heads off etc. Open mouth eating (which agitates my misophonia something fierce). And it goes on for a very long time. The sound was very visceral and also had me 🤢,3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I am a massive horror fan, but body horror is not for me. However, I heard so much about this film and I am a big supporter of a Demi comeback I wanted to support it. But it was so much for my stomach which.. I have no control over how my brain reacts. 

Loved the uniqueness and the depth of the meaning of the film, but the gore did take away from me absolutely loving it.",2

If you have issues with food (like me), that scene and some of the depictions of Elizabeth’s cooking and eating are more complicated to digest (heh) than the body horror and gore. 

Which I do think is part of the brilliance of the film for me, overall. It touches on subjects in an uncomfortable way but it doesn’t feel like exploitation, even though it’s quite brutal, absurdist and all around, sad. I felt really seen.",25

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with this movie. It is very poorly written and manages to actually come across as misogynistic through sheer ineptitude. It makes me think that most people are just very unfamiliar with horror movies in general and especially body horror, so they think this is a good one? It's not even interesting in terms of body horror - it's very basic. And both Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's...""versions"" of Elizabeth, for lack of a better word, are extremely shallow and one-dimensional. And it really annoyed me how the movie just sort of forgot about the misogynistic industry that discards women the moment they're not young anymore and frames Demi Moore's obsession with being young as a personal character flaw rather than a structural barrier. Stupid movie",3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Horror focused on things happening to one's body, specifically grotesque or psychologically disturbing things. Take The Fly for example, a horror movie about a scientist slowly turning into a human-fly hybrid after a failed teleporting experiment. 

It's basically horror focused heavily on the horror that comes from your body changing/transforming in grotesque ways outside your control and how horrifying those transformation can look like.",14
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Most of the movie is shot with macro lenses, which are like microscope lenses that can get insanely close. There is a very close up shot of a fly sitting in a glass of wine. That’s it.",6

Edit: If you’re going to insult me, u/frequentfisherman16, at least have the balls to leave your comments up. Other people should have the chance to laugh at you, too when you call Silence of the Lambs a body horror.

Edit 2: I can’t reply in this thread but I still want to respond to you, u/Penis_Genius_. It can be for multiple reasons. These studios don’t campaign for Oscar’s, and like you said, there’s a slim chance they win, anyways.  Now let me ask you: WHY is that chance so slim? The academy, meaning the voters behind the awards, do look down on certain genres and elevate certain others. That’s why the terms “oscar bait” and “Oscar snub” exist. You can tell the kind of movies that are going to sweep awards before they’re even released. Take one look at Anora and tell me that isn’t going to take home at least one or two Oscar’s.

Edit 3: still can’t reply for some reason, I think since that other guy blocked me, u/ok_movie421 I’ve commented 17 times today, and that’s way above my average. That’s a lot for you? What, are you this guy’s alt?",40

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I completely agree that Qualley has so far been under appreciated, although she hasnt really had many titular roles like she has in 'The Substance'. I am one of a seeming minority who actually liked 'Drive Away Dolls' purely because Qualley has that charisma and energy that is infectious. 

Honestly going into it I didnt really know much at all despite seeing the trailers (that did not reveal much). You are on the right lines but as the film hasnt come out yet/only just came out in many places I dont want to spoil anything. I think it is a very good surprise how Demi Moore (also fantastic here) and Margaret Qualley come to be. 

I will say the story is fairly easy to follow so it should be easy enough to understand what is happening and the stakes at play/the rules they introduce.",14

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I hope you enjoy it! 

I was very intrigued to see it when I saw the trailers and cast, but I had no expectations as I didnt feel the trailers revealed too much. They were 10000% exceeded for me, but by the time I saw it there were fewer reviews out to rightfully spread the hype about it.",1
New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I would say that right near the start of the film it certainly is on the nose and heavy handed towards setting the scene for you with the script especially. I would say too that it begins what I call 'artsy' in its cinematography.

But as the story progresses the artsyness gradually declines in line with how the story ramps up and so by the end there is little of that artsyness left replaced by what I would describe as insanity. 

The story is fairly easy to follow and due to the nature of it I appreciated that. Despite that, I would not say that it is consistently heavy handed or on the nose about its dialogue or message after Qualley is introduced especially. I think that the pacing is so spot on and the visual engagement of it (for me at least) completely distracted from feeling any themes they were trying to push were being pushed too hard, although it is very clear what they are going for.",5

id be mich more interested to hear about why someone didn’t like the poster, but instead it turns into the tired, unoriginal “there must be something wrong with you” slop. if i were forced to guess, i’d imagine you’re one of those people who believes in a distinction between “objective opinions” and subjective ones, as that’s ususlly born from the same line of thinking.",2

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,Same! I wanted to watch that movie but I’m pretty sensitive to strong graphic stuff / gore so I didn’t bother 😔 Now it’s the same case with this movie,2
New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I am glad you brought that up and I think we’ve all needed to have a genuine discussion about things besides moving around it, to preface I haven’t see it but going off what I’ve read here and in general (no spoilers, I don’t know anything that happens.)

Whenever I see him or Voight in a movie now, my first instinct is to think what’s the general reason for it. They both are open with their conservative beliefs and they were in a political movie this year, all the while this movie does come across as progressive and feminist. And AFAIK from brief reading, Quaid is the only one from the cast that’s really been outspoken about politics here… so… why him? Since he is controversial, and while I can see the point where it does seem he may be playing a bad person, I do still question it.

If it’s because he’s a good actor, it still feels odd because it can contradict the movies themes in a way. If it’s because they want to get interest in conservatives watching the movie and maybe present them with progressive ideas I can also see that. Although, I’m hoping this won’t be another movie that doesn’t really have a stance. I’ve seen a lot of hostility from certain groups being hateful to Erin Moriarty, so it really does make me wonder what exactly is trying to be said, or if there’s any kind of ulterior message or reinforcement going on.

Requiem for a Dream is one of my top 5 movies of all time, and after typing all this out and with the culture war stuff I do see why they might have casted him, but I don’t see why auditioned.",2

Movie theater hard drives can be cracked now? The Substance just dropped on the public torrent sites despite no streaming release date.,1728842472.0,"Highly unlikely this is from a “movie theater hard drive”, or what is known as a Digital Cinema Package (DCP).

DCPs are encrypted pretty intensely. Each reel of the film, which typically has 6 for each video and audio portion, has a unique AES-256 symmetric key. Using brute force to break just one of them would take years and years. (Depending on the calculation you choose, perhaps longer than the age of the universe for each one.) The other attack vectors would require a breakdown of security in the delivery of the asymmetric keys that the projection hardware uses to unlock the symmetric keys. If that breach did actually occur, you can be sure those projectors would be put on the distribution blacklist immediately and not receive future movies. So at most, if this was a leak by way of a DCP, don’t expect that to be possible going forward.

As for the watermark question. There is watermarking that is (typically) applied to the image and sound, at projection time, by the media block that decrypts and decompresses the media. It is applied in a way that is difficult for an average viewer to spot, but can be detected when a recording of the screen and sound is made and passed into the watermarking detection software. The watermark payload includes the serial number of the player, and the date and time the projection occurred.

If this was a rip from the DCP directly, using the symmetric keys, and NOT from a capture of the projection, it would contain no watermarking, picture or sound, as that is not encoded into the media inside the DCP.

Additionally, the DCP is in a colorspace that would need to be converted to display normally on home televisions. Not impossible to do, but easy to get wrong. It’s also in a different resolution than the one listed in the nfo. 

To echo the theory of others here, this is likely a pre-release screening rip, intended for awards considerations. As such, it may have a watermark of the original recipient, depending on the source.",4

So why look a gift horse in the mouth if it’s been good to you.  Especially for people raising a family in the current world it’s probably worth the 10% tithing just based on all the support system you get out of it. Instantly find families with kids in similar situations, so your kid has a social life right away. Positive adult influences and mentors (generally speaking), free babysitting, insanely useful networking for jobs, especially if you’re a professional opening your own practice you instantly have clientele. Like if you’re a dentist everyone in your local “ward” will basically switch to you. And if there’s two dentists in your ward, its not conversations about who’s better and a better deal, legitimately the only conversations are making sure both of them are getting an even split between them. Generally the Mormon church is like a Kiln, it’s going to expose the oddballs or the awkward “impurities” and it’s those people that are going to really get ostracized and bullied.

As far as very young children in theaters not specifically showing a child's movie - I just don't get it.  Little kids don't have the attention span to be involved long enough in a movie without needing some other stimuli.

I think every time I’ve gone to see a horror film since then (the past 5ish years), there’s always at LEAST one toddler or baby in a carrying seat. They inevitably start crying because that’s just how little humans roll, and without fail the parents won’t leave the theater to soothe the kid. They just wait until a worker comes in because someone complained. Then it’s a 50/50 split of if they’ll leave quietly or if they’ll loud-whisper about how rude “people are these days.”


It’s fascinating to me honestly. I think I’d personally be too embarrassed and ashamed to do that because I try to be aware of how much noise I’m making, so I’m always surprised when other people don’t really care about their public perception. I imagine they just don’t want to get a babysitter and they don’t think it’ll affect their kid if their kid watches 2 hours of gore/fear. Maybe it won’t - I’m not child psychologist after all. But from how scared adults can get from these movies, I imagine it will probably affect kids/toddlers too even if they don’t understand what’s going on.

There are plenty of age appropriate horror-adjacent films that are meant for children if you want to encourage their enjoyment of horror.

Give your kids a Goosebumps to read, or show em Earnest Scared Stupid. 



I liked 'spooky' movies as a kid and LOVE horror now, but my dad wouldn't even let me watch The Xfiles with him until I was probably 12, and good on him for doing so. ",5
"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"I agree with you on movies like Terrifier but kids need to learn how to handle fear the same way they need to handle other emotions like anger and sadness. Horror movies are a great way to do that in a controlled way. 

Also, kids aren't stuck in the theater. You can get up and leave anytime you want. Before I took my oldest to the movies to see one we had previously started watching Children of the Corn and he asked me to stop the movie when the couple thinks they hit a kid. I paused it and we had a chat and I said he didn't have to watch it f her didn't want to. A couple years later he came in my room one day and was like mom I am ready to try again and we watched it. I had to laugh because afterwards he was like that wasn't that scary. I was like I told you so.

So when we went to see Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and he said I want to leave I suggested he sit in my lap and wait 5 minutes and if he still wanted to leave we would. He said okay and before the 5 minutes was up he was already back in his seat and when I asked if he wanted to leave he said no. He had worked through his fear. 

Let me explain how that is helpful.for kids in real world experiences. When we first moved into our old house I had this giant bedroom and while we were fixing up his room he was staying in my room. My room had a big sliding glass door that led to a little balcony. One night I was in the living room watching TV when he comes wandering in rubbing his eyes saying someone was knocking on the door. I figured he had had a bad dream and brought him back to bed. I went back to talk to dad and our roommate and they both heard knocking but assumed it was him just messing around. I went back and grabbed my kid and the butcher knife and we slept on the futon n the living room. Well he slept as I couldn't. This went on for a few months. I did figure out it was some teens messing with us. That was until one night they messed up.and I was there for the knocking and grabbed the butcher knife and ran out the back door like a crazy person. They scattered and ran and did not come back. He was able to handle them messing with him though because I had already taught him how to handle fear. No freaking out or crying or being afraid to go to bed because mom will protect him and handle it. It would be great if kids could just be kids but the world at large doesn't care if they are kids and ad things happen to kids and as a parent you need to teach them how to deal with it.",-14

My worry is that some parents think that just because their kid isn’t crying or freaking out, that they’re not being internally traumatized by the things they’re seeing, which is why I reference my poltergeist experience because I genuinely thought my brother was fine, and felt absolutely awful when I found out how it had affected him later. But just like my brother there were things I thought I was ready for that I absolutely was not, like the Shining for instance, resulting in a fear of bathtubs that carried on for quite a few years, but hey I knew what I was getting into and I could have walked away and stopped watching at any time. 

That’s healthy fear that I think every kid goes through, watching a movie that kinda has you shook for a little while, but that’s something entirely different from people taking their toddlers and such to movies that they can’t even begin to understand, let alone consent to watching on a giant screen in a loud and dark theater. I respect the way you’ve gone about your parenting, sounds very thoughtful and loving. I’m looking forward to introducing my kiddo to the horror culture! But I’m certainly not rushing it haha he’ll be ready when he’s ready (he plays with my funko pops so he already knows a lot of horror icons names lol)",12

"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"It’s not about the ‘scary’ though. I feel the same way about adult comedies or romance or actions movies. It’s the adult ‘themes’. No small child should have themes of rape, abuse, torture…the worst of humanity thrust upon them so young. It’s not about coddling & over protecting. It’s about allowing kids to live for a bit without this in their lives. Please don’t take this as me discounting your experience, though. I’m glad it was positive.

I was hoping for a more serious conclusion, but yeah overall it’s one of the best movies of the year. I just get really disappointed when I think about the ending, it gets a little too stylistic and ungrounded from the actual story that its telling on the screen.

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"My favorite movie this year. The creative direction, the way it's shot and edited is nothing short of spectacular. The score is amazing and it elevates every moment of the film. The idea behind it is not new and original, but the way the story is told is fresh and uncompromising. We could probably tell where it would go from the start, but not how far it would go, and that's what makes it stand out. I wouldn't call the message shallow. Shallowness is what the movie depicts, but there are layers to the story. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the director is mocking the character and has no mercy for her. But I don't think that is the case. We spend plenty of time seeing the way Elisabeth struggles to see her value beyond the looks because of the beauty standards she internalized after years of working in the industry. I felt great sympathy and sadness for the character. It's great that this film hit the nerve and started this conversation, despite the fact that it's divisive in terms of the message and its depiction",11

The Substance is also about a equally vapid and shsllow person the audience  is supposed to care about her and find her arc engaging for some reason, I don't get it. The satire/commentary  is as deep as a puddle of ditchwater and it lacks any of the pathos or imagination of Cronenberg or the devastating realism of addictiob parables like Requiem For A Dream. It's on the nose and broad  like the Jesus allusions in Zack Snyder film. Whatever little it has to say is very stale for 2024 abd the equivalent of browsing /r/botchedsurgeries for 15 minures and going ""FAKE BEAUTY STANDARDS AMIRITE?""  Finally a movies that dares to say ""We live in a Society"" but make it for chronic-ADD types.

The runtime might be a bit much, but maybe that’s just my bladder taking. This shit rules and I can’t wait to watch it again, as fucked up as that sounds",2
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"3 1/2 for me

A very insane viewing experience in the theatre, a brilliant body horror movie and each of the casts performances was brilliant and near cartoony which I liked. My problem lies in that the stories message is incredibly surface level which isn’t always a bad thing, it didn’t ruin the movie for me but I was hoping for more depth.",2
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"So disappointed by how bad it is. The effects are cool, but it’s a black mirror episode stretched to longer than two hours with no justification. It’s edited and directed like the audience is stupid. Could’ve been great if it were half as long, or had an interesting character.",2
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"My opinion is that it’s the best cinema experience I’ve ever had. So much fun, I was laughing so much with pure joy at the ending. Just horrifying, funny, upsetting, cathartic, and visceral. I left the cinema feeling amped up with energy, I loved it! 

I love that it’s such a simple story and themes so that the sound and visuals could really shine. It really takes you on a ride. I loved and respected it for slamming subtlety against the wall, and for having the balls to keep going and going until the end. It didn’t chicken out at any moment, just total balls to the wall insanity and unashamed of itself. 

Also the only movie about self acceptance that actively made me want to be more kind to myself.",2

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"I have one major issue with the plot: At the point of the movie where Sue tries to exceed that 7 day limit and the fighting starts to happen between her and Elizabeth as both of their bodies start to 'malfunction', I don't understsnd why that disagreement exists when the premise of the movie suppozedly states that their consciousness gets transferred from one body to another when they do switch. Add to that the recurring flashcards and voice reminders from that unknown person who supplies the substance saying ""both of you are one"" or something along those lines. 

So if there exists just one consciousness between Sue and Liz, why do both of them conjure revenge plots against each other? Other than body image issues there's no indication of any possible mental disorder like bipolar disorder, so what gives?",2

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"Honestly, i wasn't a fan. I thought it was a skin deep exploration of its themes, repetitive and fundamentally flawed in its concept. It said as much about beauty standards as 'The Outside' (Cabinet of Curiosities #5) did two years prior at a third of the run-time. By the time it closed I didn't feel affected, just desensitised.

If I understand correctly, they are two completely different people, it’s not like they share the same mind when they switch. It’s basically as if Demi Moore got a  young roommate. It’s not her.

I love how graphic (as in visual design) the whole film is and this makes sense the more interviews I have watched as the director describes writing the script from what colors and sounds she wants on the screen.

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"One of the strongest examples of me thinking a film is great but also hating it at the same time since The Wolf of Wall Street.

I think, as it said, it’s great as a film but I still feel like its MODERN BEAUTY STANDARDS ARE BAD message mixed in with the WHITE MALE TELEVISION EXECUTIVES ARE ALL PERVERTS one are being nodded along with by people who will watch a Marvel movie or an ad for razors and not see the problem. 

If, on the other hand, the message is that everyone in Hollywood is a vain, shallow asshole or an embarrassing sycophant, which would include the people who worked on this film, except for a few individuals who get stepped on (like the poor guy who still thinks Elisabeth is the most beautiful girl in the world), then I can agree with that.

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"El luminoso desfile de culos es, sin duda, lo mejor de la película; sin embargo, todo lo demás resulta decepcionante. Empezando por el personaje de Denis Quaid, quien se presenta como una caricatura del típico productor /CEO/ejecutivo Hollywoodense. El cual no es más que un cliché rancio y narcisista que abusa de su posición de poder, sin aportar nada nuevo en comparación con versiones similares en otras películas.

Por otro lado, Qualley, valiendose más de carisma y atractivo visual que de buen guion, logra captar nuestra inmerecida atención con su interpretación, emulando en cierta medida lo que hizo Arnold Schwarzenegger en ""Terminator 2"". Sin embargo, llegado este punto lo único que puedo expresar como sentir de un servidor, es, lástima ante la imperiosa necesidad de la cinta de provocar en nosotros alguna preocupación por las desavenencias que se ciernen sobre la incipiente vida de Sue, el personaje de Margaret, tomando en cuenta que como ya dije no es más que un despojo unidimensional tal y como aquel robot exterminador en la película de James Cameron, pero sin las inherentes justificaciones qué hacian qué esta condición superflua en la constricción del personaje tiviese sentido en esa película.

Sin embargo, no me habría tomado ni la más mínima molestia de verter mis frustraciones en este comentario si solo esto hubiera sido lo que mis ojos tuvieron el infortunio de ver anoche. Porque a una película le puedo perdonar lo que sea, menos el arrebatarme la suspensión de la incredulidad. Si bien los efectos especiales prácticos fueron competentes durante primera mitad, una vez iniciado el clímax, se vuelven tan pobres que hube deseado tener cataratas para poder soportar la mediocridad expuesta en pantalla ante mis ojos y así no sentir que estaba viviendo de nuevo aquel doceavo y último día de reyes, sabiendo que mis padres eran los que venían a comerse las galletas qué yo ponía debajo del árbol de navidad, mientras me escribían cartas para que me portara bien y así con suerte hacerme acreedor de juguetes otra vez.",1

It did not gross me out at all, and was expecting a twist and it never happened. Was the twist supposed to be when she stabbed her heart and they both were awake? Ending annoyed me severely.

Going earlier than that I would also recommend black sheep which balanced comedic and horrific tones a lot better than the substance imo, then the Japanese extreme cyberpunk stuff from the 90s like the tetsuo trilogy and 964 pinocchio",1

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"Not that I recall, but even if it did that doesn't mean its not good. I loved it more than posessor and it really affected me in a way that a lot of body horror hasn't",2
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"Most of the hate I saw for Infinity Pool came from general audiences, at least from what I've seen.

The collision, opposition and interplay of those things gave the movie a tremendous emotional and mental charge. That, and the fact that it didn't once back down or flinch - and had the courage of its convictions.

It was  the bravest, funniest, most horrifying, heartbreaking, salutory and energizing experience I've had at the theatre in ages. Bravo.",7

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"The thing with all those movies you listed tho, are they are short.  Not one is over 2 hours.  The Substance is almost 2 1/2 hours and doesn’t have anything new on its mind after the first hour.  The rest get in, have their fun, and get out. (Dead alive drags just a bit at only an hour 40mins)

On top of that Titane won an even bigger prize at Cannes in 2021 and is gross, fun, funny, kind of messy, but also way more thoughtful in its exploration of similar themes.",6

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"Nail on the head for me, I think it would’ve been my movie of the year if it had a tight 90-100 minute runtime. I love gore and violence and superficiality but find it really difficult to justify the pure excess of this film in every way. How many times did I really need to see Qualley’s ass to get what the movie was going for? 

I will recognize how subjective that is though and I have plenty of films that I prefer longer cuts of for the pure purpose of ‘if love movie why not have MORE movie’. I’m happy body horror is having its mainstream moment right now and I hope it continues to push horror more and more into our cultural zeitgeist.",6

It's a solid trashy horror film with some great effects and performances, it's not a brave new step in horror as a medium and the people acting like it's better than what's even been coming out recently are being kinda absurd. 

I don't care about Oscars, but a lot of peeps are acting like it not getting nominations is a travesty",6

What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"I think you’re overstating it a bit. It should absolutely get noms for makeup and effects, and beyond that all I’ve seen is a campaign for Demi Moore.

I don’t think it’s rewriting the horror genre or anything like that either. But I pretty much don’t think anything from the past decade has rewrote the horror genre or been a massive step up or anything. Horror has always been great, the fact the Oscar’s won’t acknowledge it doesn’t change that.

Making “serious” horror movies hoping to be taken seriously but the Oscar’s is very silly imo,",3
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,"Make up sure, but there are people legitimately pushing for it to get nominated in everything it's eligible for which is wild. 

It doesn't have to rewrite the genre, I'm not making that argument, I'm saying that people are making that argument and I think it's pretty ridiculous.  Why can't it just be solid horror film without any dissenting opinions being called haters or not liking female directors? People are calling it the best body horror film ever made pretty regularly which is an insane argument",1
What’s your opinion about   The Substance?,1728979427.0,I just think you’re making up what “people” are demanding it is an Oscar contender. Don’t think that’s a very large contingent. You seem to be taking like sparse opinions you see online and acting like they are the common sentiment. I’ve seen zero people say it’s the best body horror movie of all time,1

¿Qué opinan de La Sustancia?,1727895401.0,"Dos cosas que destaco mucho son el apartado sonoro y visual. Los dos recursos se usan de una forma muy interesante que no veía hace rato: el primero como un efecto shock/incomodo (el sonido de la comida o cuando sale el simbolo del comercial me encantaron), y como visualmente y sin diálogo relatan tanta historia y contexto al principio. Me dio mucho placer ese ""dialogo"" silencioso y visual.

Me reencantó con experimentar algo colectivamente en una sala de cine, creo que nunca lo había vivido. El silencio dentro del espacio los últimos 20 minutos se podía cortar con un cuchillo, no se oía ni una respiración, es como que todos estábamos en la misma sensación culiá desagradable pero atrapante.

Concuerdo con que unos 3 minutos menos de culo le habrían hecho bien.

Pero bueno, desde el inicio de la historia se tomaron bastantes libertades e incoherencias para terminar de contar la historia así que ya se veía que no iba a ser algo serio.

Finalmente, en lo que debo felicitar al director es en el hecho de que en toda la peli por más escenas sensuales y desnudos no sentí excitación en ningún momento xD estaba tan asqueado por la sobre saturación de los sonidos de tripas y las escenas de sangre y vísceras que solo podía sentir asco y pena por la mujer y su descenso a la locura.

 En lo personal, me gustó mucho la pelicula, por lo mismo que ya dije, debo decir que siento rechazo por el genero del terror,  porque normalmente suelen prescindir de hacer buenos personajes o tener una profundidad, más allá de que de miedo, asco o simplemente sea bizarro. Esta pelicula fue más que eso y siento que es un avance para el genero del terror, pero el final no me convence, preferiria algo mas cliche y lindo, pero igual es bueno que los directores tomen desiciones así, e incursionen formas no tan comunes de hacer las cosas.",1

¿Por qué no les gustó el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Para mi el final es exactamente lo que termina de unir la pieza, no es al azar que toda la gente deseosa de consumir la imagen de la ""nueva"" chica terminase bañada en sangre.

Sociedad que termina manchada de sangre por sus actos.",3

¿Qué les pareció ‘La Sustancia’?,1728920623.0,"Para empezar creo que la más accesible por el reparto y popularidad es La mosca. Además te puede ayudar a ir asimilado el estilo de Cronenberg, antes de escalar con cosas más bizarras.

Mis recomendaciones personales son Crash y videodrome. Te recomiendo verlas sin saber nada de antemano, se disfruta mejor wuajaja.",1

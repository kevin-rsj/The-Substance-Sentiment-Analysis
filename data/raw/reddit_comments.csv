(At least in the US).


Also, along with the thread on beauty and Hollywood, I distinctly saw the loss of her youth at having given Sue life as a parallel to cultural beauty standards overall. A woman at 60 may despise how she looks in comparison to the younger beauties on the screen and in print, but the more time spent making the comparison, the more time and beauty are lost.¬†

Sue is this better, happier, sexier version of Elisabeth while she‚Äôs on this ‚Äúdrug‚Äù. Everything is a breeze, everyone loves her and she loves herself. While Elisabeth initially agrees to respect the rules, this better version of herself is constantly pushing the boundaries because, at least at first, Sue doesn‚Äôt see the consequences for Elisabeth, the ‚Äòsober‚Äô version of herself. It isn‚Äôt until she wakes up as Elisabeth again that she realizes what she‚Äôs actually done to herself, and she can not wait until the week is up to do it again. When it‚Äôs time to switch from Sue to Elisabeth the next time, she pushes it. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù. Now Elisabeth has to face the even scarier consequences of her actions, and she‚Äôs pissed. She‚Äôs started to separate ‚Äòsober‚Äô and ‚Äòhigh‚Äô her, and they resent each other. Sue hates Elisabeth for her lazy, slobbish, sad behavior. It‚Äôs everything she hates about herself. Elisabeth hates Sue because she‚Äôs actively sucking her life away, yet is the only joy she can feel anymore. But she still can‚Äôt stop. She allows it to consume her entirely, and by the end is left completely broken and devastated. Way worse for wear. Wishing she could just go back to normal, but unable to escape.",217

I had a blast, I personally felt like it was a very dark comedy that obviously uses excessiveness and absurdity to its benefit to supplement the social commentary. This was the most fun I had in a theater all year, actually was nearly in tears laughing, but don't mistake that for a critique of this film - it's an appraisal. It had to be intentional, all the little things like suddenly introducing out of nowhere subtitles while the monster is speaking at the end - the totally over the top name for the creature in the third title card - and the fact that many characters are just straight up caricatures. It screamed to me dark comedy, but I don't think a lot of people will experience it that way. 

The biggest thing I could do without was the constant cutting back to things to bash you over the head with ""Hey, remember this? This is important!"" That came off as a bit corny to me and it happened several times, I think it would've benefited slightly more by respecting the audience and expecting them to remember obvious threads.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me.

Qualley was fantastic too! And my goodness what a smoke show. Totally fit the 'perfect' other self. Guess I have a new crush! 

Genuine moments of sadness and empathy for Moore's character, wonderful storytelling. Was cracking up when she turned into the 'witch'.

Amazingly effective yet gross use of sound effects! As plenty have mentioned the shrimp scene was as bad as any other scene in the movie! Shout-out to Quaid as well!

Ending scene was nuts! Reminded me a little of the shock at the end of 'Ready or Not' (another fav of mine), which then dragged on and on and turned into the prolonged uncomfortableness of the ending of Kingsmen when the heads just kept exploding.

The scene where Demi Moore can‚Äôt go out on her date with Fred because of her constant obsession over her appearance was very sad. 

The technical elements are great too. They are pretty similar to Fargeat‚Äôs first film Revenge (2017), in terms of the way it is shot, edited, and scored. So if you enjoyed the vibe of that film, you will love this one. I believe The Substance is an improvement in every way over that film. Excited to see what she does next. Her and Brandon Cronenberg and going to be the faces of body-horror for years to come.",138

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,It‚Äôs funny. And gross. And keeps getting weirder and weirder and weirder.¬†,38
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"On one hand I couldn't help but feel like the premise has been beaten to death. Desperate longing for youth and beauty, new experimental procedure or product where things don't go as planned etc etc. I remember the Facelift episode of American Horror Story and one of the episodes of Guillermo Del Toro's horror anthology having a similar bit.

But I think The Substance really killed it and made something that still felt totally unique.

The body horror was relentless and I love how they tease the feeling of dread and disgust with the constant closeups. For me one of the grossest parts was Sue getting greedy and draining Elizabeth for more and more fluid as the site got more and more infected. Then finally all that comes out is some bloody pus. I felt like I spent the entire second half of the movie with my hand over my face cringing.

It was great portraying self-hatred through literally two different versions of yourself in conflict and the inevitable climax of trying to destroy yourself. One thing I didn't like about that final fight scene was how absolutely fragile Elizabeth had become in an earlier scene, struggling to stand without breaking her knee. Now she's 100 times more decrepit and taking hits like a boxer and still standing up. I think she should have died a lot earlier to keep things from getting comical but then the vicious beating could have ensued long after to really drive home the point of psychotic self-hatred.

Seeing her reflection in the doorknob was a fantastic and sad moment. Bringing everything back to the beaten up hollywood star was a cool touch.

When the final monstro form crumbled to pieces and all that was left was her face poking out I ALMOST thought her whole normal body was going to emerge unscathed and then she'd get a banal call from the company saying the experience was complete. ""Thanks for choosing us!"" But I guess that would have been a bit too goofy for no reason.",37
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"This might be ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES THIS YEAR. Holy shit, Quaid (lol ""Harvey"" I seen what you did there) stole the scene every time he was on camera, Qualley really was out to be *that* alpha bitch, Moore's self loathing doubt and her losing it after the first half of the film made me laugh ruefully for her.

The plot is makes it clear that Sue was going to sabotage Elizabeth (I thought Elisabeth was gonna get revenge given the chicken in the navel bit by way of overeating then causing her to sprout food from herself...?) but I loved it's unpredictability and descent into utter chaos at the end. The ostensible cliche phrase ""take care of yourself"" had so much weight to it, plus I love the commentary on how showbiz will chew one up and spit you out especially if you're eye candy (dear lord so many butt shots, I'm assuming commentary on the male gaze?), and also body dysmorphia and the lengths one would go for self preservation. Speaking of eye candy the chaotic cinematography is chef's kiss, I loved also when Harvey was around he would speak to the camera whether it be Sue or Elisabeth.

The end of the film with Monstro Elisasue gave me so many mixed feelings of dark humor laughter at how unhinged it was, sadness out of a fading star, and shock at the horrifying amalgamation of body parts. You couldn't help feel sorry for the Elisabeth slime's last chance at happiness as she slowly fades at her Hall of Fame star (that foreshadowing at the beginning with the burger)

The only negatives I have are nitpicks: One the slow pacing until the middle of the film, two (suspension of disbelief be damned) how in gods name did Sue become an interior designer overnight?

TL;DR The social commentary, the chaos and unpredictability, great acting, and utterly over the top presentation for the film, make it one of my favorite films of the year so far!

9/10, don't pull chicken from your navel and while I think there was social commentary to be said, Qualley's got a nice ass

  
Edit: Way off topic and a spoiler for the film Kinds of Kindness which also had Qualley >!She just can't get away from her unconscious body being dragged, huh...?!<",73

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"The movie was totally a modern fairy tale. People calling it a satire, but it has little to offer on that front. When taken as a fantastical tale on how one's vanity and self-absorption (note the recurring image of the giant photo of herself Elizabeth had put on her apartment's wall) can lead to one's doom, it works much better. 

If the movie was meant to be this scathing satire of the industry, then why show the protagonist flouting the instructions due to her own whims rather than industry's pressure? Like the first time she goes over the limit is so that she can fuck a random douchebag she's brought home, lol. (in fact, both the guys she's shown sleeping with are these dumb beefcakes; doesn't seem like her mindset was particularly different from that of the sleazy exec) Meanwhile the exec is perfectly willing to accommodate her ""week on, week off"" schedule. It almost felt like the movie went out of its way to place more blame on her than on ""society"". It even offered her an alternative in the form of the adoring fan trying to ask her older self out, only for her to be unable to cope with the fact she's not as beautiful as her younger self. Again, here's a guy who (apparently) doesn't care, but because SHE cared on a such fundamental level, she was paralyzed from taking the opportunity.

My headcanon is that some legitimate medical corporation is developing this but beta-testing on the black market. 

Another take - the doctor who recommends it to her. How would he know when her refill time was? Pay even closer attention - the number on the line sounds like his Other Self. Do you think the doctor developed the substance and wants to inflict his suffering to others? He wasn‚Äôt exactly happy in the diner.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"The way I interpreted it was that in the beginning Elizabeth was fully living through Sue and feeling the adoration. However as the experiment went along, Sue became more autonomous and let the glamorous life dictate her personality and thus became her own person. To the point where Elisabeth living through Sue was like a alcohol/drug binge haze; she may not remember exactly what happened but she still remembers the overall feeling of being beautiful and accepted.  When she wakes up and sees the mess Sue makes, its just one big hang over. It sort of like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

  
I only saw it yesterday so I may be missing something but that was my interpretation.",314
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"My take on it was Sue was like being high, and Elizabeth was the comedown",68
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,I think they didn't share the consciousness. Elisabeth was clearly shocked to see the state of the apartment,30
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"I saw it as a bit like waking up hungover and slowly remembering all the things you did while you were hammered last night.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,Yeah I feel like the lack of subtlety was one of the main points of the movie. The side characters are purposefully caricatures‚Äîit's obviously textual storytelling rather than literalism and that works in its favor.,504
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"While I love that joke, I don't think it is the criticism that people often seem to think it is. Bluntness on its own can also be an effective narrative style.",118

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"> my favorite scene of her acting was when she was aggressively rubbing the make up off and messing up her hair 

I would also like to point out the phone call she makes that leads into that scene. She‚Äôs got this innocent sort of schoolyard crush going on when she‚Äôs setting up the date with Fred, showing a real levity and ease we haven‚Äôt seen her experience yet. It really helps set up the visceral self-hatred that follows. A truly fantastic performance all around.",264
Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"For how utterly grotesque and bonkers the film gets, that date prep scene is uncomfortably real a d all the better for it.

Elisabeth driving herself mad trying to be absolutely perfect but it‚Äôs never enough because she‚Äôs constantly comparing herself to the sparkly billboard of Sue, comparing herself to herself, and refusing to let herself be happy is painful and heartbreaking to watch",131

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"Here me out, I absolutely loved The Substance's ending-- specifically the climax. That entire film, Elizabeth is a victim- she's a victim from her producer, the industry at large, and even herself. I adored the bloody theatre scene because everyone was suffering. Yes, still including Sue, but also the fellow performers, the slimy executive, and even the audience. Instead of an uplifting ending, everyone has instead been dragged down. It was pyrrhic victory, scorched earth, and it was really the closest thing that a movie like this could have to a ""happy"" ending.",42

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,its also very apparent with the picture of dorian gray references throughout the movie. Her having a giant picture of herself in her apartment where she lives not only shows the vanity but also represented how lonely she felt in her life at her age.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"In regards to the chicken from the navel:

Sue was just a piece of meat and it's all she really aspired to be. elizabeth couldnt stop eating and leaving completely empty chicken carcasses around and sue fucking hated that. Sue mostly hated it because it's gross behavior but it's deeper in that elizabeth was a carcass that used to have meat on it but had already been picked clean. Her time had passed, which is also what sue hated. i saw it a few days ago but iirc after the chicken bone navel scene sue get a lot angrier at elizabeth. Kind of reminded that what she has as sue won't last forever either. Being a consumed remnant always on her mind.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,Well said! It does place most of the onus squarely on Elizabeth but it just shows how deeply internalized misogyny can become.

Official Discussion - The Substance [SPOILERS],1726798012.0,"so whenever I watch Park Chan-Wook films I get the feeling of like a dark twisted fairy tale. I was definitely getting those same vibes watching The Substance. Nothing is overly explained. Everything is to be taken at face value. The characters are almost archetypes more than anything else - I saw a letterboxd review complaining that we didn't get to know more about Elisabeth and her 'relationship with her mother' (LMAO) but i actually like that that was the case. she was just an archetype of an aging star. the beautiful saturated colors, everything being over the top and dramatic, the way the actual logistics of The Substance are not explained at all, the way Sue literally steals life and time from Elisabeth. To me it was all a very dark and twisted fairytale. I saw in an interview the director say she took inspiration from South Korean filmmakers but it was in regards to her previous film Revenge, and she did not say which South Korean filmmakers, but I definitely felt echos of Park Chan-Wook in The Substance",42

At times I've looked in the mirror and have been so upset with how I look, comparing myself to times I looked ""better"" that I wanted to smash my head bloody into the mirror.

Whereas Sue represents her extroverted tendencies, and her love of performing (as well as her narcissistic, self-centered, and self-destructive qualities).

In Hollywood, it's outside of the norm for a woman not to have 'work done' when they get older. I doubt all of those actresses are \*particularly insecure, just realistic according to what culture 'expects'.

The creepy way that this thing is advertised and sold, it makes me thing the creator of this is some back alley scientist that managed to create a breakthrough treatment that obviously won't pass FDA approval (or through any regulatory body). So he distributes the service for free, and uses people as test subjects (hence the numbers each person is given and how he doesn't recognize his customers unless they give him their number). After he gets enough research proving that the process is ""safe"" he probably then plans to present it to the FDA and regulatory bodies to formally legalize it. Despite the fact that the service has technically worked, it's still dangerous as it causes severe psychological problems in both halves of the person it produces and it can still cause severe harm if directions aren't followed to the letter.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Had some time to digest this (and get to a computer rather than my phone).

I really appreciated this film for so many things (acting, practical effects, editing, score, etc.) but I really think there‚Äôs something special about the screenplay and that it really reflects a female POV that is missing from a lot of horror.

First, the real horror is so very internal. Elizabeth‚Äôs problem is not so much Hollywood or the way older women are tossed aside, though that‚Äôs certainly there, her real problem is the way she views and values herself. She is self destructive because the real problem is internal, it‚Äôs the way she views herself. She cannot see what we as viewers can see (and casting Demi Moore here was a stroke of genius) at any age, she is stunning by any societal standard‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not how she sees herself. She sees herself as haggard and a monster, and when the ‚Äúmisuse of the substance‚Äù takes a toll on her, that‚Äôs the toll it takes. It makes her appear on the outside the way she feels and views herself on the inside. That scene before the date is heartbreaking if you‚Äôre a woman because we have all experienced that dysmorphia to some extent‚Äîthat experience of being unable to really see yourself because of feelings of inadequacy. This really makes this film so different than most others‚Äîit‚Äôs not about being turning into a monster, it‚Äôs about seeing yourself as a monster.

The heartbreaking thing about Sue is that she's not a younger Elizabeth. She's someone else entirely. The best version of you (as a woman) isn't even YOU. It's someone else entirely. You were never good enough. And even the best version of you has insecurities because she's not good enough either.

Second, the narrative structure really emphasizes this. In a lot of screenplays, once Elizabeth unlocked Sue, Sue would have gone on to take down the man--- to get revenge on everyone in Hollywood who mistreated Elizabeth. But that‚Äôs not at all where the narrative goes. Because although there are many terrible characters, they really aren‚Äôt the antagonist. Elizabeth is both protagonist and antagonist. She is truly her own worst enemy, both in her Sue form but also in her Elizabeth form as she punishes herself by binging and trashing her apartment and destroying everything around herself. This could have very easily strayed into a revenge tale, and I think it‚Äôs partially the female POV that sidesteps that narrative to take the story in a different direction.¬†

Third, I love how the male gaze is used in this film. I think it‚Äôs very brave and effective. It‚Äôs not shown to be bad. It‚Äôs just cranked up to 11, and then 15, and then 200 until you are disgusted by it without being told to feel that way. All the huge close ups of bodies and body parts. Especially at the end, where Monstro Elisasue is just an amalgamation of body parts. It‚Äôs so in your face and unabashed. The end is seriously like ‚ÄúYou like tits? You want tits? Here‚Äôs another one for ya!‚Äù It makes things so sexual that they become completely UN sexual. And all the nudity is presented in the most clinical of settings‚Äîagainst a white tiled bathroom. I‚Äôve seen people say that they feel like the film falls into presenting the male gaze and I think that‚Äôs missing the point‚Äîit‚Äôs about letting the audience reject the male gaze in a way Elizabeth never really is able to. It‚Äôs wildly effective.

I see why this won a screenplay award at Cannes. It‚Äôs not only audacious and original but it has a POV that is largely absent from the genre and really deserves to be represented.

I could see both people on the sides of me out of the corner of my eye were reacting the same way throughout the whole movie, and I'm sure if I could see the 4 rows behind me, they were too. I've watched all the main body horror movies people talk about, and none of them got me like this.



That last 30-45 minutes is just straight up insanity. When the movie ended, I just sat there for a minute, and then I went to the lobby and sat on the bench in complete disbelief, speechless. I loved everything about it. When I saw Margaret Qualley was staring in this, I knew it was gonna be something special. She was sensational, and so was Demi Moore. I don't really know how you top a movie like this. I really believe on all levels it was damn near perfection. Maybe it could've got trimmed down just a little bit but even for a movie that was over 2 hours long, you're so engrossed in everything that's happening on screen that it doesn't even feel like it has been that long.



This might be one of my favorite movies I have ever watched, definitely one of the best horrors and by far the best theater experience. I'll be waiting for another movie to top this theater experience. Hearing the whole crowd groan and make noises and physically react was awesome. I'm glad for once a movie not only lived up to the hype, but IMO exceeded it as well.




10/10 will probably go watch it again in the theater if I can catch a large crowd.",190

The ending really worked for me. I likened it to people who get plastic surgery and are satiated for a while, only to become insecure again, convince themselves they need more, and end up botched and ridiculed.

Sue is so desperate to fix her problem that she forgets she's already a product of Elisabeth's vanity which results in her becoming a literal monster.

The audience turning on her didn't feel all that dissimilar to the comment section of a celebrity photo after some fresh work on their face.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. I went in completely blind (well ok I read about one sentence that said Demi Moore is in it and she takes some drug to be younger and I knew it was a horror film) and only learned about the movie a few days ago.

I was already fully onboard with just the out there sci-fi type premise of birthing a younger self and trading consciousness weekly. That alone can make an interesting movie. Then it goes more and more body horror and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶wow. I loved the over the top absurdity of‚Ä¶I guess the entire movie. But especially the dance scene, Sue just walking around on the street, and even her drinking a Diet Coke. 

And of course, the absolutely bonkers completely insane ending. I‚Äôm usually pretty good at guessing the ending especially of horror films having watched so many but I did not see this coming. Not like that. You know something is gonna go wrong but wow.

Demi Moore was stellar. Her best performance? And I didn‚Äôt know Dennis Quaid could chew scenery so good. About as good as he chewed them shrimps. 

Like another commenter said, my theater didn‚Äôt get up when the lights kicked on. Everyone just kinda sat there in silence for a bit. I hope this film picks up steam because it might be the best theater experience I‚Äôve had with a horror movie or almost any movie in some time. It will be a shame if it doesn‚Äôt get the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Though I dunno who I would recommend this to. I feel like the average person would think I‚Äôm at best a sex pest by the middle or complete lunatic by the end. 

Question - did they share the same brain/memories at all? I thought not but it makes you think - kinda a raw deal if you don‚Äôt get to experience it at all. I suppose that‚Äôs the point, the aging movie star watching as a younger version supplants her. But if you don‚Äôt get the memories or ability to live through your younger self directly I don‚Äôt think many would take the substance. I know they must share something somehow due to the chicken dream though. 

Also I was CACKLING during the climax. And the over the top dance. I think it made a lot of people in my theater uncomfortable (both scenes really) and I and my wife had to be the only people openly laughing out loud. The cut to the child previously so excited sobbing and covered in blood made me laugh even more. I need to watch this again.",38
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Watched it this afternoon, it lives up to the hype and honestly exceeds it. 


The first 60 minutes are a fantastic drama/scifi adjacent take on womanhood; that alone was gripping. But there were cracks in the glamour. You could feel how defeated Elisabeth was. Demi acted her fucking ass off. 


Then the next 40 minutes manages to tell a gripping story of a woman who so desperately yearns for youth that she creates an entirely new person. Not a younger version of herself mind you, just a completely new person. A *better* person. Sue begins to ascend and realizes how ‚Äúsad‚Äù Elisabeth is and grows disgusted of her, turning her into nothing more than cattle for her to take youth from. 


That alone had enough horror and poignant discussion on how we treat women in general, not just Hollywood. Also shout out to Coralie for having a real reason for showing off Sues body; it‚Äôs over the top for a reason and doesn‚Äôt feel out of place like a lot of sexualization does in horror - it has purpose and meaning. 



Then you have the last 30 minutes which is arguably one of the most insane endings to a movie I‚Äôve ever seen. This is Society meets The Thing meets The Fly wrapped in a Barbie bow. The monster design is so outrageous, the voice, the fucking cut out Elisabeth head taped on. It‚Äôs just so ridiculous and absurd and it *works*. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs so many metaphors I‚Äôm missing, but I did think that the end where she‚Äôs literally a monster, on her biggest night, spraying blood on everyone sure felt like a takedown of how we demonize having a period. Maybe that‚Äôs off base, but it seemed pretty blatant to me. 



This movie managed to not only look gorgeous, have a tight script, hilarious scenes, Demi Moores best performance ever, but also was a swift and effective take down of American culture around women in general. 



I have no notes, nothing needed to be changed. 10/10. Easily one of the best horror movies of the past 20 years, an instant classic.",31

So much to unpack, and I have got to see it in a packed theater. Best body horror since The Fly. Demands rewatches.",26
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I've just come back from watching it and I absolutely fucking loved it. I'm a huge fan of body horror films, and special effects guys like Brian Yuzna. This does not hold back.

The first two acts are relatively sedate and take a while to get going but the sound design is phenomenal. Every act gets a sound which is amped up. Inserting a needle gets a squelch. Eating a shrimp gets a crunchy squelch. Even down to the shoes that Quaid character has have these steel heels so he just stomps down the hallway.

The third act is what's going to have everyone talking though. That's where the training wheels are fully off and it goes absolutely crazy. At one point it looks like everyone is at a GWAR concert with the spraying of blood into the audience.

There is commentary there about how women in this industry are highlighted, used and then spat out but I liked how it didn't preach about it, you could argue its almost quite reserved about it in truth. Small parts like the first time Sue walks down the street people step to the side for her to when Elizabeth does a day later and people are virtually bumping into her.

Demi Moore is phenomenal in this. I don't know if a body double was used at times and I don't think brave is the right word as it sounds almost patronising but she shows a lot. To have a camera pointed at you to show where you've aged and how things get lumpy and bumpy especially when you were known to be absolutely beautiful must have been hard for anyone to do. I wonder if the fact that it was a female director that Moore took this part on. The film works on another level too because the focal point is Moore, and her history of surgery and chasing youth.

I'm so glad to have seen this on a big screen. The only downside was how few people were there. I've read online of people being in packed cinemas where people were dry retching.

- Dropping the title card in the middle of the instruction video is genius! 
- Coralie Fargeat's directing is exceptional. I couldn't look away even disgusting things are happening on the screen. 
- The first act is slow paced but once the split happens, the movie gets crazy.
- Demi Moore gives of the best performances this year. The make-up scene to get ready for the date is probably her Oscar nomination clip.
- Margaret Qualley gives a great performance.
- The movie is not heavy on the dialogues, at least from the 2 main leads, so the physical acting does a lot of work.
- The film does not do subtext and it is better for it.
- The third act could have ended after the fight or the birth of the monster but it goes completey crazy that it becomes a dark comedy to me.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I have a hot take. The film wants us to feel heartbroken for Elizabeth because, despite having an absolutely beautiful body, she can't help seeing herself as ugly, and ends up putting herself through hell trying to change. The implied moral being that we should all learn to love our bodies regardless of beauty standards. Judging by people's comments here (""no, honey, you're so beautiful!""), it seems the film succeeded in being interpreted that way. This troubles me. I think it's really the wrong message from this film. Elizabeth's core mental illness from the start was not her self-loathing; it was her self-obsession. Everything about her life was completely and utterly self-absorbed. (She makes Donald Trump look like an empathic and caring person by comparison.) Trying to help someone like this by telling them how beautiful (or great) they are is like trying to help a heroin addict by giving them more heroin. The thing that fueled her endless existential drive for external validation wasn't, ultimately, her need to feel beautiful; it was her need for human connection. And no amount of feeling beautiful and self-love would have lead her (and in fact did not lead her) to make a meaningful connection, so long as she continued to be self-absorbed.

So three options here I guess - 1) Sue cleaned and repaired the bathroom before heading to the NYE taping (we've seen she's pretty handy but was there time?) 2) Her returning home to reactivate isn't real, more a fantasy sequence? 3) I'm overthinking this and it's just a continuity error intentionally left in there to service the climax of the film.

It‚Äôs odd because, at two-and-a-half hours long, I felt like they left a lot of possibilities on the table.

Tactical editing and punctuated sound effects gripped me from the get-go and once the ball gets rolling that sense of curiosity successively builds into a truly satisfying climax. Something so hard to watch yet even harder to avert your attention from. Emotional weight unleashed with no hesitation. Felt like a Lynchian pastiche (super imposed flashbacks, dramatic sow motion, uncanny character acting, Hollywood de-glorification) if it was shot by Kubrick. The film is a bit ‚Äúblunt‚Äù on what it‚Äôs trying to communicate. Didnt give me a whole lot to piece together or carefully consider once the credits rolled the way Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway did, but it sacrifices that for a focused sense of immersion.  Overall, I loved it and I‚Äôd highly recommend. Fingers crossed this gets a positive reception. Oh and see it in a crowd.",16
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I definitely liked it but I also thought a tighter running time would‚Äôve been better for its relentlessly in-your-face style. Cronenberg told The Fly in 96 minutes.,22
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"First the body horror and sound design was 10/10 for me, def one of the best experiences I‚Äôve had seeing this film in theaters.

But my main gripe is that I don‚Äôt understand Elisabeth‚Äôs motivations AT ALL. Why did she go through this process when the end result has no benefits for her?

We establish that Elisabeth aligns her self worth with her looks so the logical through-line is that she‚Äôs willing to do anything to feel beautiful again, but the substance only makes a younger and better looking clone of her. Elisabeth does not experience anything Sue does, she‚Äôs basically in a coma whenever she trades places. So what‚Äôs the point?

I could maybe see that she would want to live vicariously through Sue like a parent might do, but Elisabeth resents Sue from the beginning and her presence only makes her feel worse about herself. 

Then I thought maybe she‚Äôs willing to do this since she needs money and can‚Äôt sustain her way of life since she‚Äôs too ‚Äúold and unattractive‚Äù to do her previous job, but the film never makes a note that she‚Äôs struggling and even if she was fired from her job I assume she‚Äôs made enough over the years to live comfortably. 

Also, why was Elisabeth so distraught when Sue didn‚Äôt respect the balance and made Elisabeth age more by not switching in time? Elisabeth didn‚Äôt have friends or hobbies and when she was in control she stayed in the house all day. If she was already unhappy with the way she looked, then I‚Äôm not sure why becoming uglier would affect her so much.  

I‚Äôve seen this type of idea put on screen before where a woman does something drastic to regain/attain beauty but then it goes wrong and the end result is that she‚Äôs worse off than where she started. If the point of this film was just to make a gory film spectacle like Terrifier that‚Äôs not meant to be analyzed or hard to think about, then at least make it shorter (the run time was kinda long). It would‚Äôve had the same result and shock value imo. 

Someone please tell me if I‚Äôm missing something? I personally think character motivations such as this can‚Äôt really be swept under the rug since it‚Äôs the catalyst for literally everything that happens in the movie.

Tldr; Elisabeth‚Äôs motivations for taking the substance were unclear to me since none of the results seemed to benefit her in any meaningful way.",10
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"An absolute masterpiece. It was disgusting and touching and unique.

I have to say though, everyone's been calling it the grossest goriest film ever made, and I really didn't think so? *Bloodiest*, probably. But while it certainly had the back opening and the teeth and the knee and all of that, I didn't feel sick like many people have said or feel that it was much different than what I've seen in a lot of horror films. Yes, I went ""eugh"" several times but the kid trying to gouge his own eye in Talk To Me was way worse than this. Not to make it sound like anything negative, I still loved the film, but I'm a bit confused.

Especially during Sue's first shower, the way she feels her new body is not for us, but for her. She is lusting after her new, younger body, and all of the camera angles just drive it home. Pump It Up was a visual love letter to her new body,   
  
I'm not denying the fact that the world they live in is run by a skewed lens where certain bodies are commodities in an extreme way (compared to ours lol), so it would make sense for there to be ""gratuitous"" body shots, but so much of it is how much Sue loves her body and we just get to be along for the ride. 

It forced me to rethink how I viewed those shots, like it was all self-love. My first reaction is always like, ""Okay Michael Bay, we get it, she has boobs"", and don't get me wrong, as a Bisexual Disaster, I'm down for anything, but normally there's no substance behind shots like that (pun not intended).

But I think, since the film is partly addressing the male dominated film / entertainment industry (the women's washroom in the Kubrick hallway is closed, forcing Elisabeth to use the men's toilets, also decorated like The Shining), I think Fargeat may also be saying:

""Look, as a female film director (especially in horror) these are the tools I've been given to use. All the references I have are from male directors, because women were locked out of the industry, so I'm going to use the tools of this male-dominated art form to say something about the experience of women.""

Yes! I love how you put this.

The commentary on Hollywood/celebrity culture made me realize that ""Hollywood"" as a cultural force is quite literally psychopathic - as much as Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, is. The industry and the culture will support movies like this w/ a critical message of harsh body image standards,  all the while continuing to prance forth creating and reinforcing a culture and community that is barely exaggerated in *The Substance*.

And yeah, when the final monster version wore the Demi Moore mask and purged a boob and all the blood was really hilarious. By the end it's a Troma movie and is amazing for doing that.",19
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I'm also wondering how their consciousness worked because you do have to wonder what was in it for Elisabeth. Also the original of the guy who gave her the USB knew about her being on the substance - did his younger self leave a note for his older self ""I signed up Elisabeth Sparkle!"" The story and the payoff work well without it all being explained though.",6
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I thought they shared a consciousness but the third act kind of threw a monkey wrench in that because they were able to fight one another in separate bodies. 

Before that I figured they shared consciousness but the contrast in their appearances and people's reactions to them made Elisabeth adopt a sort of split personality and led to the resulting resentment when Elisabeth bore the consequences of Sue's greediness or Sue's life was interrupted by the need to go back to Elisabeth. 

But then how do we explain the fight?

Because if it's more of a cloning scenario I find it hard to believe Elisabeth would be counting the days to be Sue again since for her it would essentially just be a week-long nap, but again...how did the fight work?

Loved it though! Such a great film and so many great themes.",4
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"My read on the brain/memories is that the original and other self shared all background and memories up until the point where the other self split off, at which point their minds split as well and they each carried only memories of their individual bodies‚Äô experiences from that moment on. So theoretically Sue has all of Elizabeth‚Äôs memories from the time until she split off as Sue, but not after that.¬†",3
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"The ""hit you on the head"" style satire speaks to the movie's rage toward society and the issues it's critiquing, but I think there's a lot of very sophisticated artistry underneath the sledgehammer.",12

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I don‚Äôt think they were duplicate consciousnesses, though there are moments where it seems that way. I saw it more as the way an addict might blame themselves for the things they do while on drugs, or trying to separate the ‚Äúbad‚Äù parts of yourself into a separate identity. Both Elisabeth and Sue want each other to control themself, but each has bad habits stemming from how they feel in the different bodies (Elisabeth eats unhealthily because she dislikes her aging body, Sue steals the regenerative fluid from her older self like a drug in order to stay young longer).",10

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I actually think that plays into the themes.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"There are scenes purposefully shot, though, that show she is 61--and perhaps they used a body double, but I remember the backless dress while she was drinking alone in the bar was lit in a way that made her back look covered in wrinkles and protruding bones. Close ups of her body in the bathroom scenes. Her face looks much younger than her body when she is naked, without perfect lighting, etc.

It makes sense--the director said in an interview that the ending, her face smiling because it was free from the body that she felt betrayed her.",12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"No, that is the theme of the movie.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This isn't the Fly or Cronenberg though. This is the Substance by Coralie Fargeat, and she told her movie in 2.5 hours. Who cares how long a different movie by a different director is?",17
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"She isnt in a coma. She literally IS Sue. One consciousness. But consciousness is also heavily influenced by age, hormones, state of mind etc. Its not a clone, theyre the same person. As Sue she reverts to not only looking younger but also acting younger. Immature, reckless etc 
 
 
 
She resents her younger self for not taking better care of herself (much like many do in real life, except for us our younger self isnt fucking us over every 7 days, they fucked us over 25 years ago)",18
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Sue and Elisabeth are the same person. One consciousnesses taking turns in one body.

Why do people engage in all a manner of self destructive behavior like taking drugs or excessive gambling... because it feels good in the moment. Sue and Elisabeth are the same person. They wanted to be young and beautiful and loved. The moments of being happy seemed worth the moments of being bitterly unhappy. In the end, maybe it wasn't worth it. But it wouldn't be the first time someone chased the promise of being happy even when it was clear there would be costs.

Put another way... take a real like example. Jennifer Grey was succeeding in Hollywood, making money and booking good gig. She got cosmetic surgery thinking it would make her ""better"" and instead it made her so unrecognizable that it derailed her career. Why would any person go through the pain, risk, $$$ etc. for cosmetic surgery. Because they person tells themselves it will be worth it, they will be ""better."" But it's always a lie. You can never reach perfection because it's always off in the distance no matter how fast you run.

People do this every day-- hair implants, extreme diets, cosmetic surgeries, weird beauty treatments, etc.

Elisabeth didn't realize how deep her own self loathing went. She thought she'd be happy in both personas, and that it was enough. Turns out she was wrong.

Of all the character motivations in horror movies, I understand this one the most. Are you telling me you'd turn down the fountain of youth or a chance to be your best self?",6

We should also consider that this film was made BY a woman, which I know that doesn't always make things better (i.e., Slumber Party Massacre's director Amy Jones having to add in a random super-nude scene to placate producer Roger Corman), but this film is all about \*obsessing\* over one's looks - whether in self-loathing or infantilization/wonder. It emphasizes the very real conscious AND unconscious act of body-checking (specifically for women) and how it stems from the obsession with how others perceive us. It's masterful, and I love Coralie Fargeat so damn much! A GENIUS.",5

Oddly enough, that's one of the places I've just recently noticed has lost a lot of youthfulness on me. And the amount of times I've gotten dressed up, put my face on, feel great ... and then had a crisis of confidence when I look in a different mirror in different lighting...it's happened many times.

At 45 I feel invisible when I go out to a bar now.
I think it‚Äôs worse because I used to get a lot of attention when I was younger. 

Getting older is terrifying. It‚Äôs like watching a flower wither, dry up and die. 
Society‚Äôs view on aging will never change for that reason. No one likes to look at a vase of withered flowers.

The beauty of youth will always be favored and no matter how many face lifts women have, they always look their age - you can‚Äôt fight it.",8

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I loved this movie bc it‚Äôs making several different commentaries simultaneously. There‚Äôs the clear theme of the pressure women feel in our patriarchal society. There‚Äôs also just a thread that highlights the inner monologue of an insecure person, and the brutality and self-sabotage we all inflict upon ourselves. We‚Äôre our own worst enemy, right?

But the most poignant theme for me is the commentary on addiction. I‚Äôve had struggles with that before, and to me, this was actually the main theme of the movie. The phone pinging with messages like ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù while Elizabeth sits in darkness was too real. Or when she‚Äôs laying in the shower, banging her head on the floor saying ‚Äústop, stop‚Ä¶.‚Äù I bet a lot of people know exactly what that feeling is like. I know I do. Glad I‚Äôm not there anymore. 

The whole concept of someone recklessly stealing time and physical health from themself is all about addiction to me. The self-hatred, the isolation, and the diminishing returns all ring true. The idea of slowly killing yourself while pretending everything is fine is something most addicts can resonate with. And there‚Äôs a couple a serious nods to Requiem for a Dream, especially the infected spine injection scenes‚Ä¶.

It‚Äôs a brilliant movie. I‚Äôll be thinking about that one for a long time",5

It‚Äôs pretty clear Elisabeth has self esteem issues from the jump. Even when her exercise show is going well, it‚Äôs a show about taking who you are and changing/improving it. As though it‚Äôs just a given that no women can ever be good enough, there‚Äôs always something to improve.¬†

And Elisabeth is Sue... even if she's different looking on the outside. Her insecurites and self-loathing followed her into the Sue persona.

The Substance really just heightens what she was already struggling with. You have to work through issues, you can‚Äôt medicate them away or put makeup on them or cut them off with a cosmetic surgery. If there‚Äôs something bothering you inside you have to work through it genuinely.",29
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,At the end as Monstro started to melt away for a brief moment I thought that an entire 'original form' Elisabeth was going to be left behind (rather than just the face) and she'd get a second chance to love and appreciate herself as she was.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Movie was hilarious. Things can be both sad and funny at the same time. The curling iron or earring scenes being played up for laughs doesn‚Äôt make the movies message any less poignant and I‚Äôm glad the director realized that because she clearly made those scenes with the intention for them to be funny.,11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Some men were laughing at Elisabeth when she was trying to get ready for her date, and getting increasingly frustrated at her appearance.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I think the disconnect was because of her different mental state between bodies.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Did you notice Sue had both eye colors when she woke up before fighting? I think that is a hint to the idea that they split there.,11
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I think injecting some of the termination serum and then switching (after 1 day since last switch that was 3 months late) could have caused a weird side effect where the mind actually did split too.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"I found the scene of Monstro getting ready for the show very touching. The way she stood in front of herself in that mirror. The way she didn't hesitate as she placed those earrings on her head. It felt like a moment of acceptance, and that was the medicine she needed all along.",12
"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"This is being highlighted as a friction point for a lot of people in a number of reviews, but for me it worked on a sort of subliminal/intuitive level. In terms of what is shown in the movie, we clearly see a transference of perspective when Sue is ""born"" and the whole 2001 sequence occurs smashing into her first person POV. I took this as Elisabeth's consciousness being transported literally into Sue, so the same consciousness is operating for each week period in whatever body has been animated. I think the movie makes it unclear because we see Elisabeth and Sue both call the Substance company to complain about ""her"" actions, but I think this reflects the way that Elisabeth/Sue are unable to see the alternative body as belonging to them for various reasons that I can't fully articulate. Elisabeth cannot overcome her resentment even though she **is** Sue, and Sue doesn't seem able to see herself as Elisabeth; she steals the stabilizing fluid even though it's damaging the version of herself that...I guess she'll become? (It's **definitely** unclear what would happen if this situation didn't implode within the few months the movie spans IIRC; would Sue age into Elisabeth? Would she age at all? Does she only break down because they mutually abuse the system, or would she always have had a limited shelf life?)",8

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,"Unreality is a great way to describe so many elements in the movie.

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,Now I‚Äôm thinking about the diner scene again because her mocha latte magically appeared and my thought at the time was continuity error but now I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs a bunch of those moments,8

"Official Dreadit Discussion: ""The Substance"" [SPOILERS]",1726752269.0,I also found it sad that when she looked at the door handle that was one moment where she went back into the bathroom.

I‚Äôm 23 and I think Demi at 61 (which is also my beautiful mama‚Äôs age) is a million times more elegant and beautiful than I am at my age, and not just in her appearance, but because she has maturity and experience, a kind of worldliness about her and visible signs of a full, wonderful, and dynamic life she lived, if that makes sense. It really got me thinking about why we as a society fetishize youth so much. When I look at a woman who is 50 and older, I am struck by the beauty gained by the experiences that she had through the years. I feel like a baby adult who doesn‚Äôt know anything, I find so much beauty in older women who know who they are and have taken the time to learn themselves and know themselves, and who stand grounded in that.",181

But wow. Wow. One of the greatest cinema experiences I've had in a loooooong time, maybe ever, and I'm always at the movies, very up to speed with what's out and what's going on in film and horror in general. Felt like I was watching something I'd never seen before. Amazing. Going back on Thursday to watch for a second time as it hits wide release on the 19th.

Definitely a film that you need to see in a cinema. It could be watched, and enjoyed, at home, but it's certainly the kind of film that is really elevated by the cinema experience. Easily going to be one of the most talked about and biggest movies of the year, and already an instant cult (or maybe not) classic. Dammmmn.",101

I've been looking forward to this since the first trailer I saw, and it didn't disappoint. I don't even really classify this as horror, just fucking balls to the wall crazy. Every single thing about this movie was purposefully cranked to 10 and the 2+ hrs run time just completely flew by.

Can‚Äôt stop thinking about ‚ÄòThe Substance‚Äô ,1726145495.0,"Saw last night, woke up this morning thinking about it.

This is how I can tell that the symbols are functioning as such. I suppose that‚Äôs my most basic test for whether a movie is any good.

This is why I watch horror movies. It seems the usual method of making video entertainment is to throw in some symbols, hope something sticks‚Ä¶ And it seems that horror alone follows symbols to see where they lead, and then the filmmaker reports their discoveries honestly.

Just a few examples from the movie: the glass box in which Elizabeth lives overlooking the city, the entire bathroom lol, the hallway to the bathroom, which is inexplicably spiral inside the other otherwise cubic apartment, the hallway at the TV studio, the camera lens, the colors‚Ä¶ god that pink is oppressive!

I was so suspicious that the movie came from an intellectual/social commentary perspective. The kind of movie that would have been better as an essay. But no, this is the real deal. A dream that shakes you and stays with you.

It‚Äôs a real exercise in empathy to watch this as a man. I feel like I learned something about my species in my time and place.

Anyway, it‚Äôs a very good movie. I feel the same drive to watch it again, unpack it, look under the hood to see how it works‚Ä¶ The same way I used to with the Coen Brothers in their heyday (Barton Fink through Inside Llewyn Davis)

It‚Äôs very clever, very well-made, very true. 

Oh yes, and very funny. Though I was the only person in the movie theater laughing, which was surreal. Like, am I the only one seeing this?!",31

Can‚Äôt stop thinking about ‚ÄòThe Substance‚Äô ,1726145495.0,"Just saw it tonight and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it either. I avoid body gore at all costs so I put this one off and went in hesitantly, my hand halfway over my eyes. But by the first body gore scene I was entranced and couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off the screen. But the message, symbolism and overarching theme of this movie had me so hooked that I wasn‚Äôt bothered by the body gore. I felt empathy for her character as she sunk further into chasing her younger self + perfect face & body. She kept going, knowing there would be consequences, but she didn‚Äôt want to give it up. Body/beauty perfection can be addictive and often we don‚Äôt see the damage we do to ourselves until after it‚Äôs done. Extreme dieting, ED, cosmetic surgery, procedures, etc. taken to extreme lengths to achieve perfection, body dysmorphia, we end up hurting ourselves in the long run.) 
*recovering from an ED so a lot of this movie resonated with me*
Being accepting and happy with how we look as we age can be difficult, especially in a world of such demanding perfection for women to remain youthful and perky, while men age, look older, without being criticized or objectified. 
It‚Äôs polarizing and this movie did an amazing job at showing what a nightmare being objectified and chasing perfection can feel like. ‚ÄúPretty girls should always smile.‚Äù Raise your hand if you cringe when men say that, and how young were you when a man first said it to you. I can‚Äôt wait to watch it again. Excellent movie; the best I‚Äôve seen in a long time.",9

I tend to be weird about body horror--if it leans camp and over the top, I'm usually fine, but if it is too realistically visceral, I get grossed out. Slashers? One of my favorite genres! But I saw the Suspiria remake and the sequence with the dancer made me feel sick to my stomach.

The way the rapid cell division took place was actually demonstrated quite well in my opinion and knowing the budget made it all the more better, the scientific aspect of the body horror made it all the more terrifying.

The desperation that sets in to become the best possible example of human genetics is ironic given the fact that you literally are manufacturing it rather than trying to embrace it

It just seemed that the message could be a little more subtle, more nuanced. But it kept beating over the audience head with the message ""all men in the entertainment industry wants to use womens bodies for their evil intent mwhahaha"" Dennis Quaid is awesome in the role.

Parts of the plot were a little forced. You mean to tell me a Oscar winning wealthy famous celebrity would go, by herself, all alone, into that little dingy door? Fuck that. Could be an organ harvesting room, or for kidnapping, she doesn't know!! But noooo, she proceeds without a flicker of a doubt, because plot.

It's also the rare horror movie that swings bigger and bigger all the way to the end. It really goes for it, and whether or not you think it's fully successful, you can't deny the ambition and execution and the sheer spectacle of it.

However, the film treats the audience like an idiot. I don‚Äôt need flashbacks and callbacks to stuff that‚Äôs already happened in the film to remind me of a plot point, it‚Äôs not a series. Also was a great message but didn‚Äôt need it spelt out for me so much at the end.

The super close ups of something with a bass beat drop or gross noise got old quick, and as much as I liked the effects in the beginning of the film, what we saw near the end was so comically bad it took me out of it. At one point Demi Moore looked like Spike Jonze as an old woman from the Jackass movies. I think there were a lot of cool parts to the film though, just presented poorly and with no restraint. I‚Äôm just a spoiled film snob that‚Äôs seen everything though. Some late teen/early 20 year old is going to see this movie and it‚Äôs going to be their gateway to looking for more messed up films, and that‚Äôs ok with me.",5

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"I think it was good but less emotionally engaging than i would have liked. It felt like the principle desire was to get hurridly to certain scenes without really investing in the moments in between. This meant I felt a bit disengaged apart from the obvious shocking bits. 

I think the concept of a ‚Äúyou are one‚Äù is very interesting and I think can lead to misconceptions about what is going on. I think Sue is more of a child of Elizabeth than a conscious sharing being but Elizabeth allows and wants Sue to continue in the way a parent may continue to support a child as much as they lose their own life and individualism (eg a parent drops their kid off for soccer practice).

The fly is heartbreaking because surreal horrible things are happening to characters who feel like 3d people, and this felt like everyone was meant to be totemic clowns that represent archetypes. It was like a parable or a fairy tale, which I get, and it was hilarious, but not my thing as much.

I can see how this film will appeal to a tiny vocal minority of horror fans but mainstream audiences are either bored to death or getting up to leave when they can't take anymore punishment(which I think is what the director wanted to do). The final act in the film is so ludicrous and frankly dumb that I thought only  a French director would try this. Sure enough got home and found it was made in France.,15

Add to that the recurring flashcards and voice reminders from that unknown person who supplies the substance saying ""both of you are one"" or something along those lines.

Have you all seen The Substance yet and what did you think?,1727041292.0,"Spectacular.

I attended a scream unseen screening the other week, and was overjoyed that it was The Substance, a film I've been excited about since I saw a brief teaser trailer, and as a big fan of Revenge, I was very excited, although after Long Legs failed to deliver, I was wary of letting myself get too hyped for another horror film this year, and expectations were tempered going in.

I needn't have worried. The Substance not only met my expectations, but far exceeded them in what I can only describe as Requiem for a Dream meets The Fly with a side helping of Society.

I couldn't have asked for a more delightfully intoxicating and disgusting film. Members of the audience were audibly gagging at times, and I have to say, I loved every second of it.

Just finish seeing it a half hour ago in the theater.  My my initial thoughts: 

Holy god. 
One of the years best, easily. But holy god.

- so many Kubrick references and homages, as well as DePalma and Lynch. And Cronenberg . Both Senior and junior. Even a little Billy Wilder.

- I hope Demi Moore gets recognized for an absolutely fearless performance.

- Best make up and special effects - much of it had to have been practical - I've seen this year.

- holy god

- what is it with French directors and surreal, absurdist body horror? Feels very much in the spirit of Titane.

- the last 30 minutes are fucking wild.",1

Feel like it could've been paced better (there was clear fat to be cut) and some points maybe missed the mark emotionally (laughter when - at least personally I felt - there shouldn't be) and it completely throws subtlety out the window but my god that last 30-50 minute stretch was worth the price of admission alone.",27

Also haven‚Äôt heard an audience that buzzed or chattering opinions that much for some time after, too. Only one walkout from what I saw: just as Sue‚Äôs first show was being shot. 

I think the term Cronenbergian is used a bit too much in regards to body horror, but the satirical style of this really reminded me of the likes of Crash and Videodrome, particularly in regards to the growing prosthetics and makeup. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley were both great, although Dennis Quaid stole the show in his scenes. 

There‚Äôs a real conflict of the horror and humour at times - the cooking/ chat show scene walks the thin line between the two perfectly. And there‚Äôs a good deal of fear factor and tension aside from the body horror elements. Certainly a lot to unpack here, and I look forward to doing so.",18

The long scene renovating the bathroom to hide the body was unnecessary, just drag it into a closet and we‚Äôre good.

The impossible beauty standards that become internalised, the male gaze and misogyny, fear of ageing and the loss of identity when losing your career due to nothing other than being seen as too old, lack of self-confidence in your value beyond how you look, the consequences brought to your later self by selfish choices and not caring for the impact or for your future wellbeing, the fear of abandonment and desperate need to be loved ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just what hit a personal note, let alone the rest!

(And one element I‚Äôve not seen discussed yet is that of the role of Elizabeth as the ‚Äúmother‚Äù, and very much like the pushy beauty pageant moms that make their kids live out what they never could or to relive their glory days through them.) 

I was told by my partner this was a ‚Äúbody horror comedy‚Äù, and I went in without knowing anything else about it.

Great acting by Demi Moore, need to cast her in more Horrors, and Margret Qualley was great too. Dennis Quaid was great but his character was probably the only bad part of the film as thet went overboard with the stereotyping.

However, with all the older films being shown, I saw Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Spidey Homecoming and Batman Forever yesterday, and Star Wars 3 then Substance today. Next weekend, there's about 6 films vying for my attention.

Anyway, I hadn't read up anything about the film so had just seen the trailer, but to say it was weird is an understatement. It was like a Cronenberg film, but without the name, albeit quite a slow start that I'd mostly skip over if I was going to watch it again. I'm toying between 8.5-9/10.

Plus, the same female director made 2018's brilliant Revenge, which hand plenty of gore, and is basically the ‚ÄòKill Bill‚Äô that Tarantino should have made, as I thought those two films were lacking overall.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"A great experience but I don't think it's a film that I'm likely to revisit. It was enjoyable but didn't have as much to say as I wanted it to.

As many have said, The Substance isn't concerned with subtlety or nuance.  It's got one point to make, a sledgehammer and some inspired body horror.

There are obvious comparisons that can be made, but the one I'm stuck on is Under the Skin. I think they share a lot of the same DNA - bold, bonkers, divisive and heavily stylised. I love to rewatch Under the Skin though. It speaks to me in a way that The Substance didn't. 

I appreciated the satire but I don't know how successful it was. It's a film about the male gaze but it never subverts that - it's just very male gazey. It wants to satirise figures like Harvey Weinstein and Vince McMahon, but Harvey gets no comeuppance, instead he gets a lot of laughs. It wants to satirise society's insane reactions to women aging but turns Demi Moore into a monstrous hag who becomes insanely jealous of a younger woman's success and then dies horrifically.

I'm glad I saw it. I had fun with it. It ticked so many boxes for me (show me gross shit accompanied by noises that make you feel like you're losing your mind, I'm normally happy). I'm not sure I thought it was a great film though.",1

That whole second act was painful to get through for me, and those two breaks I took were during that act. 

Third act was easier for me to stomach completely, much easier for me to stomach compared to that anxiety inducing second act.

Possibly the best film I would never go see again, it was kinda wonderful seeing how uncomfortable I was watching this film but fuck me, do I wish I had an empty stomach coming in.",1

Felt like the movie overstayed its welcome IMO. The big finale scene with the audience didn‚Äôt land for me, either. But the last image on the Walk of Fame was pretty great and just bizarre/hilarious.

I think the movie was good, but could have ended like 10-15 minutes earlier.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"SPOILER ALERT
I'm not a guy who particularly cares about morals in media, but imo the message of the film conflicts somehow with how it is described in the reviews: in the narrative world the substance can be used indefinetly if applied as prescribed (""maintaining the balance""), a fact which avoids an honest reckoning with the ultimate futility of maintaining immortal beauty/control of bodily functions. so it boils down to the following: the failings of the users is an individual fault, and the elizabeth/sue monstrosity in the grand finale is an object of ridicule. - so I think the film somehow fails in this regard. with it's handling of topics of sexism, ageism in the industry, body shame, reproduction etc the movie is somehow clustered and all over the place, a lot of cool ideas and allegories half-exposed and discussed. - this out of the way: I think the movie is great at conveying the bodily horror technically, it's male gazing zooms on frantically swinging hips and oozing wounds. Moore's performance during the first half (when the tone of the movie strikes a better balance between the comic and the tragic) is superb - contrast it to the scene where she cooks and watches Sue in the tv, where the ""comedic"" and audience distance took way overhand imo. qualley's performance is great too, but I quickly got fed up with the shots on her - the technical critique of the male gaze gets repetetive quite fast imo. really enjoyed the sound.

I find the quieter shots on Moore's body really interesting: thematizing cosmetic surgery. her lips in the wakeup shot, her buttocks when she's about to take the activator.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"I loved the movie. Yes it was way too long and the pacing wasn't perfect, but the atmosphere it creates is intense. The cinematography is also spot on. The two leading ladies carry the whole movie. Good use of prosthetics.

The most disturbing scenes are not the violent or body horror ones which are not even that intense, but the fear of ageing and the obsession we have for the passing of time, opportunities, fame/exposure and our past selves. The scenes where Demi looks in the mirror and then compares herself to Sue and constantly touches up her make up and her outfit are so heavy and everybody I think can relate, especially people past 25 who are starting to see the signs of ageing and the first changes in their appearance, men AND women.

The moments where she is hopeful and then everything turns for the worst well represents the risks and foolish things people are willing to take and do to look young. And it can be anything: drugs, diet, digital filters, fillers, surgery, fake teeth, fashion choices...

I hoped the feminist elements wouldn't be as pronounced as I think this is, in different ways, a universal experience especially in our modern social media mediated times. But the meta element of an ageing celebrity played by someone who was recently scrutinized for her facial procedures and looks was also a boss move on Demi's part.

Another detail that I found disturbing was the lack of information provided with the substance: it really captures today's beauty market so well with tons of energy based and at home devices and products that are sold with little care and scientific studies and people use them with little guidance and knowledge... a growing phenomenon is severe facial fat loss induced by microcurrent, lasers and radiofrequency devices. This was captured flawlessly in how Elizabeth jumps on The Substance with little hesitation and little care for the whole process, even when things starts getting weird. And the meth addict symptoms were poignant as well.

As for the finale, I loved the camp ending, it helps balance the uneasiness of the central/later part of the movie but I guess there were a couple of other directions the movie could have gone and explored so even if it is not a masterful scene per se, it was able to surprise me. But it was a fun scene that clearly pays homage to a cult classic and gives a strong statement about how, at least in hollywood but in modern times in general, the ""audience"" is what feeds this narrative and this obsession for beauty and youth, so everybody is guilty in the end and the whole splatter thing is a release of all the nasty emotions embodied by the monster. 

In the end, it's one of those great movies that stay in your head for a while and create a sense of uneasiness but also offer a chance for profound thinking, and it is technically well done and effective.",1

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"This is if Cronenberg, Lynch and Verhoeven made a movie but more visually striking than Refn. This movie is the definition of unapologetic. I was not ready for how much everything escalated by the end, and the movie was not shy or subtle about the points it was making. I was blown away by the starking visual contrast between ""beauty"" and ""ugliness"" and yet the movie made them both gross and sexual at the same time to ultimately expose us, the viewers, for our unhealthy gaze.

The substance is so successful at getting us to show every emotion humanly possible towards the main character, from disgust or pety, to covet, to blame, ultimately makes an unmistakable point about why we are unable to love ourselves. The paradox that it is us who are creating this culture, but at the same time we are powerless. This is the ultimate visual depiction of self harm. We wish we could stop, but we also wish we could go even harder! It shows patriarchy, show business, and capitalism hand in hand with the human nature in destroying us, through our own actions. We are covered in our own blood. The walls are covered in blood.

Yes this is a feminist movie, but it by no means is set to alienate anybody. Every person who has ever experienced the feeling of not being enough will empathize with the main character. We see her desperation and greed and connect with her pain.

Our reaction to the violence, nudity and the grotesque nature of the movie is how the director feels about the violence and hatred we are subject too. And she does not hold back. Yet the movie is daringly silly and absurd. The comedy in this movie is absolute gold. The villain is hilarious, even the body horror is hilarious, the sex is hilarious. The absurdity of this movie is so refreshing.

In terms of runtime, the movie takes its time to escalate. It is never stagnant, but it's also not in a rush. After all this is a visual experience with many paradoxical points and it needs room to build up and peak before the next stage.

This is a masterpiece that cannot be overhyped. My only note would be I wish they didn't do the hamfisted voice overs at the end. I know most viewers would have missed that point. But I don't think it would have taken away from the movie. Maybe it could have been done in a less obvious way, or just left as Easter eggs for the second watch. Really felt like something the studio forced them to do last minute, and it took away from my experience. 9.8/10.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Just saw it today, and wow, I thought it was brilliant, though some in my audience seemed to think it was over the top, especially by the end. To me, I've never seen a movie quite like this, and mad props to Fargeat for executing something so personal with such a high level of artistry and confidence and Moore and Qualley for allowing themselves to be so emotionally and physically vulnerable to put this on screen. For as darkly funny as much of this movie is, it's really got a big emotional heft, and Moore carries a lot of that with her performance and walks the balance of the emotional part and the absurdist black comedy so well. It can be a tough watch, not just because of the gore really, but honestly because Moore's character almost feels like she's at war with herself. Her character's self-hatred and self-abnegation is just crushing to watch on screen. In a lot of ways, the movie feels so much like a psychological horror movie as well before it goes full on body horror extravaganza in the final act. I really think that is because we are so pulled into the interiority of Elizabeth/Sue, to the point that the movie even switches to their first person perspective in several instances. 

I personally loved the ending; for me, it was like pulling the release on a valve and just releasing the pressure on all these heavy emotions and ideas building throughout the movie and almost was like a relief. Oddly enough, I actually found the ending to be the least nauseating; it was just so outlandish that it just kinda became hysterical and full-on satire at that point. The movie up to that point just has this heaviness and tension to it because you really do feel sorrowful for what Moore's character is experiencing; the final sequence just feels like one giant fuck you and condemnation to the whole hollywood culture around youth and beauty and like the ultimate way to ridicule it.

The first 2/3 of the movie definitely had my stomach churning at certain points (surprisingly the worst being watching Dennis Quaid eat shrimp). A lot of the food stuff in particular was just so nasty to me. I think people will be surprised about the moments in this movie that are emotionally disturbing and anxiety-inducing. Moore's scene in front of the mirror where she just kept going back actually made me so anxious because the self-doubt and emotional turmoil was so relatable, and you can feel the desperation and sadness she is going through. The body switch sequences were almost clinical and I felt like it just tapped into all these anxieties and fears around watching our bodies deteriorate and being poked and prodded by doctors as we get older. And Qualley's dance sequences were just so uncomfortable with the music and the camera movements. I was just really amazed how this movie almost felt like it was breathing through the screen with a lot of the textures and sounds. The sound, set design and makeup are just superb and just make this film such a sickening joy to watch. 

Maybe it's hyperbole, but to me it really feels like one of the most unique visions I've seen in a film in a long time. I really can't wait to watch it again, the first time is such an assault on the senses that it's definitely hard to process this film in one go.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"What a movie.  It felt trite in the beginning (yeah, yeah, you're old and no one wants you anymore, boo hoo), but I was on the edge of my seat and wringing my hands the whole time.

Did anyone else leave feeling like they had to be kinder to people?  I don't mean to sound pathetic, but that never happens to me.

I was sort of frustrated that she didn't have any friends or family in her Elizabeth Sparkle time period.  No siblings, long-term friends, anything like that.... and of course ugly people have friends too - maybe not as many - but it went to show that it reminded me that you need to make an effort and that fewer people care about what you look like (when you aren't a total monster...and even if you are, it's probably not your fault).

A lot of messages in media might say 'Don't chase glitz and glamour' but few do it in such a  surreal and imaginative way.

Also, was anyone else confused as to why there were children at the NYE show where there were topless dancers?  What the actual hell.",0
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"My score: 2/10

The Substance is a high-budget B-grade film purporting to critique Hollywood, sexism, aging ostracism, and the overall beauty industry. However, its execution feels reminiscent of a self-indulgent adolescent's misguided attempt at profundity.

The film is rife with gratuitous blood and gore, accompanied by an abundance of rubber suits, all while showcasing glaring plot holes that undermine its narrative integrity. While it aims for irony and artistic satire, it ultimately falls short, presenting a convoluted and excessively lengthy experience that lacks intellectual ""substance"".",0

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"One or two moments of flashing and fast lights - largely just after The Substance itself is taken and the ‚Äòother self‚Äô is unveiled. Also as one of the central characters‚Äô grows more famous there may be occasional moments of paparazzi-like camera flashes, although these are somewhat infrequent. The BBFC does have a photosensitivity warning on its website for the film though, which is usually a fairly good indicator.

Not sure if it‚Äôd have a similar effect, but there‚Äôs also some pretty rapid editing here and there. A car crash scene early on and also during scenes where a fitness/ workout show is being filmed (actually may also be some flashing lights as part of this). Third act in general also might have combinations of both due to some of the events and settings, where the combination of things might just make everything seem that bit more intense(?), but obviously no spoilers. 

Overall in terms of flashing lights, there are a few moments here and there. I think generally though, if you‚Äôve seen the trailer in the cinema (which itself has its fair share of lights and fast cuts) that might give you a good indication of what some of the film‚Äôs sequences might be like?

I get the purpose of a lot of the nudity and hyper-sexualization in the ‚ÄúSue‚Äù chapter, but at a certain point I felt like I was just watching the same thing over and over and over and it was no longer serving the plot in any way.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,Not the OP but I thought the first 2/3 were great commentary on youth and beauty with excellent acting. Then I was taken out of the visuals and acting by the over the top batshit ending. To each their own but it ruined the whole experience for me.,1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Not the comment you are replying to but I hated it. Like, I feel genuine anger about how much I hated it.

The message was so surface level and in your face. They did nothing to subvert it, just had excessive close ups of ""look at this old haggard woman of 50! Now look at the hot 20 something!"" which it plays straight for so long that by the time we get to the over the top final third, I was just waiting for it to be over and couldn't even bring myself to enjoy the batshit body horror I came for. Like we are supposed to think the characters pursuit of youth and beauty is foolish, even though in the weird make believe reality of the world life is over for a 50 year old Demi Moore, forced to hide away in her home and gorge herself on meat because she's past her prime. 

There was 0 characterisation beyond ""she's old and ugly therefore sad"" and ""she's young and hot therefore happy"". Which made me utterly unable to engage in her plight. Was surprised to find it was directed by a woman, because I could have sworn whoever responsible for that claptrap had never met a woman in their lives. 

Stupid movie that thinks it's being smart but utterly fails to say anything that hasn't already been said before in far better ways. I'm shocked a majority of people enjoyed it, I was bored stiff from start to end.",1
The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,"Are you referring to Tetsuo The Iron Man? Need to find this as it looks so cool. Any film that the film makers decide to use black and white as they didn't think audience would not watch to end if in colour, is bound to be good.",2

My friend blames the weed.  
I don't think it was the weed since high tolerance. But I definitely felt anxious throughout and I don't think the weed was the source as much as I'd love to claim it was for my ego's sake. Definitely was one of the most anxiety inducing moments I've seen in any film. 

EDIT: Noticed I didn't say what scene it was, it was the splitting scene.

Monstro Elizabeth was grand for me, totally grand. Can't do needles though nor could I hack her sewing Elizabeth back together, came back after my smoke during the sorta realization that she needs to 1000% switch body back to her old self, missing most of the parts where Sue is living her best life.

The Substance (Official Discussion),1725915908.0,yeah it was a little unclear to me until the end whether she was transferring her consciousness each time she switched or whether sue was a separate consciousness who just had elisabeth‚Äôs memories up to the point of her activation of the substance,1

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"This echoes Titane's reactions. And who remembers that movie now? Shock value movies are good for this - stirring up conversation, getting a bunch of people online write ""OMG, you won't believe this"" posts, and maybe satisfying the core fan group who likes that sort of thing.

Cannes in general is kind of an odd place, with those reported 9 minute or so standing ovations for every movie. It's a circle jerk, this is part of it and it probably will be forgotten.

And honestly, I have no idea why movies like this, Titane or The House that Jack Built don't choose to debut at SXSW, or some other thematic festival...they could get more genre hype behind them and a well-timed release could then make them into decent/good box office hits. Whereas by debuting at Cannes, these films act like they are high brow art, when body horror is really a niche (and rather weird) subgenre, they get some online/critic hype and then tank in cinemas.

Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"Next year's Oscar race in the best actress category is at this point seemingly going to be Amy Adams vs Saoirse ronan and their movies on paper seem like they have a shot. I doubt this Cannes hype will last until awards season and Saoirse is kinda overdue. 

And actually, considering Emma Stone just got an Oscar for pretty much playing a sex obsessed prostitute, in explicit scenes, I think audiences/awards committees are interested or not against edgy material, but is anyone interested on awards level interested in a body horror that is another play at ""Hollywood likes only younger women?"" What is the message? Demi Moore who at 60 still looks better than most and who made her entire career on looking hot, because she never was much of an actress and she's a millionaire is questioning why she doesn't get cast anymore that much? I'm not really seeing how the business did her bad when she got 20 million I think, the then highest salary for any woman, for Striptease which was sold only on her nudity and hotness. So basically the reality is, if you're young and hot and not much of an actress, when you start getting older, Hollywood and showbiz moves on. I don't see this happening to people like Jodie Foster, Cate Blanchett, etc., maybe because they actually are good? Not sure how that's something evil. And even moreso, what men over 60 are treated by showbiz like hotness? I'm not seeing that too either, older men too have to kinda fight father time to stay in the loop.",-5

I heard that Noemie Merlant in The Balconettes has a scene at the gynecologist where her character shows vagina explicitly.

Pearl definitely deserved a nomination in my eyes too but I think the performance was too ‚Äúbig‚Äù for the academy, as opposed to them not nominating a horror movie. It‚Äôs easy to just say ‚Äúoveracting‚Äù and dismiss those kinda performances.

Get Out, Black Swan, The Sixth Sense, Silence of the Lambs, The Exorcist, The Omen, Misery, Rosemary‚Äôs Baby, Carrie, The Shape of Water, Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth, Sweeney Todd and Jaws all were heavily nominated or even won big at the Oscars. 

But most of those tend to have pretty subdued performances as opposed to Malignant style acting. 

It‚Äôs easy to say the academy doesn‚Äôt like horror but horror has won best picture multiple times. I think it‚Äôs more that larger than life and borderline campy horror movies are more discriminated against. Pearl, Hereditary, The Babadook, Us, The Shining and Midsommar all deserved acting noms but all those movies had actors hamming it up and I think that‚Äôs the bigger thread connecting them than just the academy not liking horror. 

Cause Jodie Foster, Cathy Bates and Natalie Portman have Oscars for horror movies. And that‚Äôs putting aside nominations like Toni Collette in The Sixth Sense (for my money, one of my favorite performances ever). But you can never go full ham in a horror movie and expect a nomination.",3
Cannes: The Substance Reactions,1716159999.0,"Outside of the head crash, basically everything else is deep in the 3rd act. The rest of the movie is basically the most unpleasant family drama ever.

And I only mention it because you said Black Swan, Silence of the Lambs and The Sixth Sense arguably weren‚Äôt horror enough. I‚Äôm comfortable saying all of them are horror, but I can argue that it‚Äôs mostly a suspense movie until it transitions to supernatural horror in the last few minutes.

I know it‚Äôs a satirical, humorous, and overt message about aging, beauty standards, and the male gaze but despite the campy tone at times I actually found this movie to be quite sad at its heart.

Demi Moore hasn‚Äôt been in many projects in years and is now in her early 60s. For her to do this indie left of center French horror film when she doesn‚Äôt have to‚Äîto be this aging character that had been put out to pasture‚Äîi just found her performance really courageous and vulnerable. 

The scenes with her alone as Elizabeth were heart breaking to me especially when she stands her date up because of her self hatred towards her appearance. And how she falls further into isolation and depression due to her compare/despair mentality and how invisible and ugly she perceives she is. I actually teared up at times because I saw myself in certain parts. Like how many times I‚Äôve changed clothes before I date, looking in the mirror multiple times, eating junk when I‚Äôve felt sad, etc. 

I think this movie is a great metaphor about self-hatred, how it leads to addiction, and the distortions and deformations both those things cause when we don‚Äôt have a sense of self that is free from the hostile unrealistic standards of society.",56
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Yes, I saw it at Frightfest in London a few weeks back. Superb film, possibly my film of the year (Vying with Furiosa for the top spot).

I'm really looking forward to it getting a general release so I can see how it goes down with the general public, because that film goes pretty wild, and the trailers (up until now) do a decent job of not really giving away just how wild it gets.

Reading womens' opinions on it is going to be very interesting. All my female friends and mutuals came away incredibly positively about it.",48

This was probably the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years. The cinematography was beautiful. The internal struggle in Elizabeth was heartbreaking and I also related to Sue. The clear commentary on agism, the beauty standard, plastic surgery and the desperate clawing for youth was not lost on me. 

But what really made me sad in the activation stage was how Sue just left Elizabeth on the bathroom floor. Didn't close her eyes. Didn't try to move her to a more comfortable position. Didn't try to set up a cot or something for her. It was like the self hatred was palpable from the beginning. 

My only question was - they were one - but did they really remember each other's experiences? When the consciousness was being shifted back and forth between bodies, did Sue have the mindset of a 20 year old? Or was Sue/Elizabeth still a 50 year old consciousness who was desperate to be in a 20 year old body? Was that the self-hatred aspect as well? Or even just an agism of the self?

It reminded me of a mix between the movie Looker (1981) and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Carrie (1976) (won't say why so I don't give spoilers away and a bit pressed for time). I think the movie is an omen to the rising vapid influencers and similar who are doing just about anything to beautiful and relevant. It was symbolic of how we have a fight we being authentic and yet having everything we think is valuable such as youth and beauty but those things don't last and are missing something deeper. In the end it points how we've lost the way and destroy ourselves to the point of being like a cancer that nobody wants.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I thought it was very good commentary on body dysmorphia and addiction. I thought the film was very expertly crafted and kind of realistic in terms of how the world looks when you are dealing with those things. The way that half of the movie takes place in her bathroom, the way she always managed to keep it hidden, always closing the door just in time before anyone else can see her switch, etc just hit really hard. I was half expecting a plot twist that her original body was never really altering and this whole time she was just imagining herself like that. I actually kind of liked the ending though, or at least I can‚Äôt think of a more powerful way they could have ended it‚Äî it would have been too easy if she killed Sue and lived the rest of her life as a hermit, or if she would have killed herself which I think ironically would have been too happy of an ending. The way I interpreted it was that she could have maintained a balance between Sue and Elisabeth and it would have all been okay, but she didn‚Äôt have the willpower to do so because of how powerful the addiction and shame spiral was‚Äî she no longer cared about protecting her body, she just wanted to stay high on Sue until it destroyed her body to the point of no return. Her new lifestyle was unsustainable, and because of that she now had to live with the consequences. 

All else aside, it was also very campy and slay. Very very well shot and very good soundtrack. It was very uncomfortable to sit through in the sense that it shook me to my core. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been this disturbed by a horror movie in theaters in a long time.",8

I‚Äôm in recovery myself so maybe it‚Äôs just the way my brain works lol but the way she‚Äôd have to RUN to the bathroom to extract more time from/for herself (sort of like a ‚Äúfix‚Äù) and to keep from getting sick reminded me of that, especially when she did it in order to be able to perform. 

I‚Äôm typically not one for mixing comedy and horror but this one did it perfectly; certain moments that would usually make me laugh actually made me uncomfortable and I just sat there with my hand over my mouth like ‚Äúwhat. the. fuck.‚Äù Some parts did make me laugh though which was clearly the intention. 

Demi‚Äôs performance in this is absolutely unreal. I don‚Äôt remember her being that good?? The cooking scene while she‚Äôs watching the interview is gorgeously disgusting, infuriating and hilarious. I forgot for a minute that I WASN‚ÄôT watching Jessica Lange in AHS. I started to really feel for her as the movie progressed and she began to hate both (all?) versions of herself more and more. I think a lot of people can relate to the mirror makeup scene, followed by what I interpreted as a depressive episode with isolating, ditching plans, not taking care of yourself; in other scenes also the overeating, increasingly negative self talk, LOT of mental health and external/internal validation themes. When Elisabeth and Sue started treating each other like shit, saying really terrible things and literally fighting ‚Äúeach other‚Äù (fighting herself), I was like ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not very good positive self talk.‚Äù And the bells went off when I realized it‚Äôs not far off from how I sometimes talk to myself.

I found every single scene and every single shot to be remarkably assured and surreal, like a writer who never wastes a single word, or a choreographer who focusses as much on small finger movements as broad steps.  I am very open to rich critiques of this film, but in terms of auteur prowess, this is an 11/10.  If you can stomach body horror and like good films, you absolutely must see this movie.",3
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"It's a bit Picture of Dorian Grey (living life while the thing in the back room pays for it), a bit Jekyll and Hyde, with a very modern theme of aging-out in Hollywood - specifically for females. Throw in some Cronenbergian body-horror and a style reminiscent of Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream for good measure.

Bravo to the filmmaker and the actors - they really put themselves out there. You're going to feel something by the end of the movie, which isn't something I can say about most horror films.

For all the over-the-top sexuality and gore, this is an extremely sad movie. Trigger warning for more sensitive viewers, but I think this is what the horror genre needs.",3

At first I thought Elizabeth experiences, or sees through Sue's eyes in the 7 days Sue is active. But I came to realize they're just two different people..

So what is the point of the substance? To make a younger version of yourself, but it's not actually a younger you, a whole new person who kinda looks like you. Then they get to get live their life and feed off you.

How does it benifit the main person? They don't get to feel that young feeling or go out and have fun.

That's all I was confused about.",3

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I know this post is older, but you said you wanted to discuss so here's my two cents from watching it tonight:

Fantastic cinematography and sound design hindered by a derivative plot. It felt like it was trying to do what black Swan did, except the themes of anorexia and ocd are replaced by themes of aging and, well, Hollywood. I really enjoyed the body horror segments but couldn't really get behind the pathos, especially considering how it felt like a more shallow version of Black Swan.

In my showing the film was preceeded by a trailer for A Different Man starring Adam Pearson, an actor with elefantitis. This kept playing in my mind during the final scene and what was supposed to portay a physical representation of the pain of Moore's character felt like a mockery. Perhaps this was a case of bad timing or perhaps it said something about us as an audience. I found this quite fascinating and it made me question my own prejudices in a way that was definitely not intended.

Ultimately,  I wanted to like it but I didn't. Visually, it did everything right, but the substance just wasn't there, no pun intended.",8

You could blame Sue as technically it was all her fault, she disregarded the rules and starting fucking shit up first, being a little time/energy thief. But then you could blame Elisabeth for thinking jabbing herself with a weird drug was a good idea, and not to consider that if she hates herself, then her ‚Äúperfect, better version of you‚Äù would probably also hate her.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"I honestly thought it was quite a poor film. Yes, I get the undertones of Hollywood - American culture in general - always wanting younger and prettier 'next big thing', but who doesn't know that? We all know that when a woman reaches a certain age, the establishment (across the board, not just Hollywood) ousts them and brings in someone younger (why do you think that news anchors all look like plastic-skinned androids?). We know this! This film isn't anything deep or meaningful, or saying something that hasn't been highlighted a million times before... Is that the selling point of this movie and what it is hinging on? And, of course in today's world, the males are the biggest, most disgusting and most evil caricatures of a real person. Do you not think that this narrative is getting old? Planting seeds in young peoples' minds that all men are 'evil' is not healthy and leads to a confused outlook on life, based on a half-truth and today's narrative. That is not a good thing.

Back to the culture: young woman feel the pressure of an impossible perfection - again mainly thanks to America  -  but is it not a tad self-obsessed and childish, as an adult, to still be hung up on 'being young'?
Plastic surgery is horrific in of itself - weird looking, moulded cat people - and if that is a theme, then it should have pointed in that direction. If anything, the underlying story should be about the evils of going under the knife and the mindset that brought a person to that point, with the protagonist realising that they are their own version of perfect, just as themselves. 

Now for the movie itself: the story was nonsense. It couldn't stick to its own narrative and if anything, Sue was an entirely different person from Liz, like they weren't at all connected. It didn't make sense. Then, Sue wanting to abuse then kill her old self - 'the Matrix' - surely knowing that if she does, she'll also die. Surely she knew that. It's stupid. Was it a commentary or a gross-out slapstick comedy? It was all over the place.

The third act. Jebus wept. Talk about being out-of-place. Where did that come from? The gore was more extreme than a b-movie classic, but again, stupid (how much blood does a person have?). Was the film wanting us to think about the 'themes' or be grossed-out? Sad or enjoying the gore? Look for meaning or switch-off?

Just my rant.",2

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,Agree 100%. The psychology of self hatred was beautiful and tragic in this depiction. Both Moore and Qualley brought their A game on this one. Two women in the audience walked out shaking their heads with only about 35 minutes left. Too much? Too real? Too close to home? Who knows! I loved it!

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,Yes it'll be interesting to get a female view. My one concern was it felt a bit 'have my cake and eat it' when it came to the male gaze. It wanted to satirize but was also very happy to linger all over a nude Margaret Qualley.,40
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"As a man in the healthcare and beauty industry: I just watched it,  didn't feel grossed out but rather more sympathetic to young and older women out here. Even the men. Also shows the egotistical women nowadays. I'm an open-minded, young gentleman. Nothing like the creepy seafood french cuisine lunatics we have running the fashion and beauty industry. You're all beautiful in your own way. 
Beauty treatments are to enhance your self image, not change it to the point that now, you're another person. It can backfire with the psychological aspect, where one can end up hating their old self, become addicted to the newer, more youthful self. We all want to be loved and appreciated by others. 

Now for the women nowadays. This term feminism is not understood by majority of women today. Creepy men are hated by gentlemen and women. Anyway, feminism has made women egotistical. They think their beauty can run the show, but in fact it's the same fitness routine. She got the job, never changed her routine yet no one noticed and preferred the young woman except the one weird nerdy guy that always liked her the way she is. Apart from the one man,   the legacy of old Elizabeth disappeared in an instant. All spoken out of hatred, by her newer self, Sue. 
My warning to all, especially extreme feminists. Respect the gentlemen, don't put them down just because they're not model looking. Oh he's 6ft, that's perfect. Shorter, ignore him and let him suffer. Oh, he's not got a great face, ewww let him suffer. So, this mentality creates more evil men, joining the shareholders group and they'll profit from your beauty and you'll turn into puppets instead. Don't become a monsto and end up looking like a mess. Respect great men. Respect great women. We all have our flaws, don't focus too much and live your life. Elizabeth was never in a relationship, Sue was abusing her looks to get the natural tall, model men. For fun. Yet it's only those men unfortunately portrayed as only caring for sex. Not everyone revs the pedal and fuels their ego,  pictured as the male Sue of today. 

Men don't put make up or utilise certain beauty treatments. Nothing wrong with beauty treatments, it's a tool to enhance, not to change.  What we do as men, is accept our heights, good 6ft or not so good (judged by both Elizabeth and Sue's of the world), accept our male genetics despite all the negativity from women like Sue and Elizabeth. Both are one. Men are put down constantly. 
So this film in my perspective, is fuelling bad feminism and once again, not realising all the actual hard work us guys have to put up with. Financially lacking, no woman wants you. No height, women (even the short women apparantly deserve the height difference lol) hate you. No muscles, skinny,  again no woman wants you. But for men outside of the film industry, we all appreciate you, young or old. Its preferences and being open minded. If you find it ewww, don't tell them they're eww, it's soul destroying. 
Don't be that old man following Elizabeth, embrace your beauty. Beauty you can't change. We can lose weight, remove wrinkles under our eyes, put make-up on to enhance, apply creams to enhance your youthful skin and maintain them. But you can't change genetics. Height is the  one thing we can't change. Sue was called little or small, can't recollect. But the creepy seafood CEO called her small, despite her being the same height as him. Sue playing with her looks so the neighbour doesn't complain, again something weak men fall for. 

So, don't be Elizabeth and Sue, in personality. Also, don't be too crazy that you see yourself as unlovable. That goes for men as well. I just found out that the woman behind this fantastic film, is a feminist. This shows, and i need to address this as no one pointed this out and saw it in her viewpoint. No one wants to acknowledge the point of view of open minded men like myself who understand this, although i love seafood... Stay safe and smile, both men and women, young and old, tall and not so tall. Mr Safology",-8

The pressure of self-harm, self-loathing, need, etc. just obliterating on stage and dousing the audience that created this monster (words from Harvey of ""creating"" perfection) was deeply symbolic because itcentered on Elisabeth/Sue's own doing in response to the vicious cycle, and the director hyper-focused on that.",12

I absolutely loved the movie, and as a woman, I weirdly got very attached to the main character.
Saw one of the posts where a dad says that his daughter got attached also and yes!!! I absolutely can understand it
Why I think it's cinema worthy?(Even though it doesn't matter)
The aesthetics, the music, the metaphors, the actors and their acting, the originality, the complexity, the heaviness of the movie, the randomness and also the comedy.
I said it was funny how some people said it's puerile because watching the movie I thought about the men in the movie are puerile and kinda stupid.

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"See id argue here that first it‚Äôs not the undertone of the film (youth obsessed Hollywood, going under the knife) but that‚Äôs the overtone. This is a film about the female experience from youth to motherhood, ageism, and beyond. It‚Äôs about loving yourself and hating yourself. And the destruction that comes from the latter.

I‚Äôd also say it‚Äôs not an ‚Äòall men are evil‚Äô film, but it does point out the obvious inequalities that still exist for women in any walk of life that don‚Äôt for men. A systematic issue that still exists whether we like it or not and is proven widely (ahem gender pay gaps).

This is a film about the experience of women. Granted not all women. But many of us. 

From medical neglect, impossible beauty standards, and misogyny. 

The film is crass, gory and ridiculous yes. It‚Äôs got B movie vibes (that i personally loved). 

For me it told a bizarre-but truthful story of what it‚Äôs like to be a woman. It‚Äôs bloody, scary, complicated, competitive and sometimes fucking depressing (especially when someone tells you to smile more cos you‚Äôre pretty).

Elisabeth made sue who has the appearance of a young teenager but sue made monstro and what is younger than a teenager, a child, a lthough not physically a child, she is mentally a child. She is basically the child of sue and the grandchild of elisabeth, who wishes to carry out their dream to be on stage. A child however doesn grasp the concept of beauty or ugliness, thats why she is able to prep herself before going on stage without looking disgusted and shamlessly drag herself on that stage.

I could just imagine a patient coming home from work one day to discover their family Rottweiler has gotten loose and mangled your own body.  There's enough risks to go wrong within the Substance alone, then add to that all that could wrong outside of it.

And then, the cavities. Would you still have to brush and floss your other body every day? They're still alive and would still succumb to bad breath germs. It's a hell a lot of work just to have 7 consecutive days of being hot at a time. I'll stick with face creams.",34

Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"The Kubrick patterned hallway and toilets are in the studio. The teeth and nails removal also happens at the studio, as do some of the more ""Elephant Man"" scenes.


The studio to me seemed to represent the film industry, with ""Harvey"" the boss being a direct reference to an abusive, male Hollywood executive. When Elisabeth goes to use the women's toilet, it's ""Out of Order"", so she's forced to use the men's.


I wondered if this was some kind of comment by Fargeat that, as a female ""horror"" director - especially an auteur - she can't avoid being compared to iconic male directors and can't avoid using the tools and tropes that they established. There simply aren't enough female auteurs - especially in horror - to draw from. In order to reach the spotlight, she's forced to walk a path laden with the work of older, male directors.


To me it felt like Fargeat was very deliberately referencing male horror auteurs in this film, partly to pay homage and partly, in a film about how the patriarchy dominates the entertainment industry, to say ""Look, I'm forced to use these tropes established by men, but I'm going to use them, and subvert them, to convey women's experiences of that world.

I also really like the termination scene. It's her really getting rid of the addiction, but even then she just can't. I feel like I've seen or at least can imagine say an alcoholic pouring alcohol down the drain and immediately regretting it and trying to salvage what's left.",16
Has anyone seen The Substance yet?,1725963539.0,"Yup!! This was my main takeway too. Not specifically Hollywood substance abuse, but addiction in general.

And just the whole concept of stealing time and physical health from yourself. Putting on a facade that everything is fine, when you‚Äôre literally killing yourself.

I think at the very least that you‚Äôre correct in identifying commentary on the industry. And that there‚Äôs a reason she has to use the men‚Äôs bathroom. The safest interpretation of that is simply that it highlights the industry‚Äôs lack of support for women and the emphasis on men. 

But I think there‚Äôs definitely something to what you‚Äôre saying about having to ‚Äúact‚Äù to appeal to the male gaze. Not just physically the way Sue does but on the meta level, as well. The Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch references are almost the same thing as Sue lol. 

There‚Äôs definitely conversation to have there, whether it‚Äôs intentional or through the ‚Äúdeath of the author‚Äù view that intentionality doesn‚Äôt matter.

If it helps, I had a theory that the city design in Transformers One had skyscrapers on the ground and on the ceiling because it created a mirror-like division in the city that visually embodied the division between Optimus and Megatron and thus the autobots and decepticons. 

Ended up asking the production designer about it and he said that was actually the intention.

It really resonated with me, as someone who has been there before. There‚Äôs a bunch of subtle nods to this theme that are just too real - bailing on plans, watching your phone ping w texts like ‚Äúare you okay,‚Äù the specific set decoration that captures what a place looks like after a bender.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"Great movie. My take is that it is meant to view the transformation as a metaphore for cosmetic surgery - creating a split personality - one that is adored for their beauty and youth, people starting to treat you differently than before (lookism). And then there is another one, the old one, knowing that it is still same person behind the facade, with some of the same problems than before, eating disorders, realising that the new look is not all-transformative, even starting to hate the new person for being fake, fearing for the future look as the aging is inevitable. And when another cosmetic surgery (another transformation) is needed, the visual outcome may not be a desired one and there are only hints of the original person left, the rest is just a mess of flesh, out of proportion, out of place even. It could be a superficial take, but this is what resonated with me some time after viewing the film. So in essence, it is a message of warning.",4

I don‚Äôt understand her motivation, though.
I get it, if she would exist in both bodies, sharing one brain/ memory, and just switched between them. That way, she could relive her youth, which makes sense.

I hate to get too real here, but the trailer really resonated with me.

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"ive only rly seen overwhelmingly positive reviews so here‚Äôs my honest semi positive semi negative thoughts. i thought it was really unique and i loved the concept and most of the movie! however i found it really weird and ironic (since it is a movie making a point about hollywood only caring about the young fresh new meat and casting aside older actresses) to make their nudity scenes so fking long like okay we get it Sue is young and hot and Elisabeth is old and worn out let‚Äôs move on now (not saying nudity is bad and i understand why we had to see the younger body to compare it to the older one it just felt uncomfortably long). aside from the nudity scenes, a lot of scenes were far too long and should have been cut significantly shorter. the extra pan ins and close ups felt very male gazey. the ending could have been way shorter and also why do they hammer it into our heads that they‚Äôre both one/the same person but it really felt like neither had any control over what the other was doing? on top of that, Elisabeth Sparkle kept doing things to fuck over Sue, over eating, ruining the apartment etc but Sue was never physically impacted by the choices Elisabeth made? When Sue was out for longer than 7 days it made Elisabeth older, but when Elisabeth binge ate and lazed around it didn‚Äôt impact Sue. I also feel they could have made some things a bit more subtle, sometimes it felt like they thought the audience is just stupid so they had to hammer points in but some subtlety could have made it so much better.

So, my take was that it's still her - Sue has all Elisabeth's memories, but at the point of Sue's creation, Elisabeth's reality diverged into 2 different paths. The original Elisabeth will stay in her old body, but the duplicate of her gets a do-over. So in a way, she is still experiencing her new better reality. If she werent so vain at her core, they would have been able to exist in balance.

But as the other substance customer lamented; the 'better' version ultimately gets greedy, because it was vanity in the first place that lead them to take the substance",75
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"I think the idea that they were two different people at the end is one of the broader concepts the film was trying to illustrate. We idealize the younger, fitter and more beautiful version of ourselves to the point where it feels like ‚Äúthey‚Äù are totally separate from who we are now. Like our whole sense of identity and self worth, especially for women in the entertainment industry, is intrinsically linked to our looks and fitting the beauty standard (which is upheld by the patriarchy). 

Fighting to stop time, molding our physical bodies into what society deems acceptable through painful procedures, eating disorders, and other forms of torture, creates a massive internal conflict- Elisabeth was essentially at war with herself. 

But we are one. we are still the same person now. To preserve purity, innocence, and youth, you symbolically, and sometimes literally, destroy the version of yourself which has aged and has gained wisdom, experience, and resilience as a result.",39

Even tho she created a copy it was an exact copy of her. I'm guessing someone that's willing to take a Substance just to relive their youth would be just as reckless as a younger form ot themselves or worse as it turned out. They were the same mind, just 2 separate bodies.

All she did was create a carbon copy of her selfish self but younger, better looking, and with a younger, more devil, may care attitude. When the New Year's opportunity came up, it was what she always dreamed, so she was gonna have it come hell or high water. It was her ultimate dream.

Instead of just accepting that we all get older and when our younger year's are behind it and our curtain comes closer to being drawn she got given an option.

Ahh so wot your saying is they keep hammering home the same theme ü§î or message because and again I'm just assuming here a women who wants to recapture her fading beauty makes a deal with devil and takes some supplement finds herself needing more to keep up with the beautification facade and then finds herself turning into a monster only realising by the time her body has started to degenerate she was in too deep?

Again, this is all guesswork on my part, but it seems a logical conclusion to the trailer and the way the film looked like it could play out.

I also think it was a creative perspective, and its use of body horror to be provocative but appropriate. I wouldn't throw out the whole movie, but I totally agree with you that them showing every plot point multiple times *did* take away from the movie. I literally had a moment to myself where I thought, ""Fuck, is every movie going to do this shit from now on? Hit the audience over the head with the same shit multiple times because most viewers are so distracted they'll miss even the most obvious messages?""

In other words, I agree, but I guess it didn't completely ruin the movie for me.",1
Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"The other film as someone else pointed out is a film called Revenge its pretty graphic and there are some highly unpleasant scenes obviously I don't wanna spoil it but I know some people get uncomfortable watching some things so just thought I'd warn ya. I really enjoyed the film, and you can massively get behind the main protagonist who's female.

Yeah I know wot ya mean I turned 40 this year and I've got greys in me hair, me beard, nose hair lol haven't got any ear hair yet tho I think I might legit cry when that happens.

I'm quite vain , but I wouldn't say I'm a hottie either probably 4.5/5/10 on the looks front throw my personality into the mix, tho I make it to a 7 I reckon.

I think, like u said, if done well, this film can play on all of our insecurities as its human nature to want more and further seek self-improvement and even perfection (another good film, btw) dare I say it so I'm hoping simple story she takes the formula to seek perfection and then it starts playing havok on her older body so she uses it more and so on and so forth.

I can't wait. Wots longlegs like, btw? That Nic Cages new film isn't it?
Love me, some Nic Cage, hehe.",2

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"Erm, I'll be honest I didn't notice that I was too engrossed with the guy getting ready to rip Elizabeth a new one, then he goes full on super sleaze wen sue opens the door. I wouldn't say u tripped too hard it just means you were paying a lot more attention to the surrounding aesthetics than I was. 

I spose there's plot holes in every film if u look hard enough. I thought the film on a whole where you've got Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid plus Sue whoever she's played by it came off as an indie film with that Hollywood polish which I don't normally like I like my indie films to stay indie but I rather enjoyed this film I think Dennis and Demi were fantastic in their roles Sue well she didn't have that much dialogue and she kinda felt she was only there for the obvious reason which was to look like a younger hotter version of Demi Moore so job done. Although her chasing Elizabeth down the hallway and goin full on super roid rage was pretty kool.

As a whole I really enjoyed it tho.",1

Can we talk about the new horror film The Substance?,1721735492.0,"See I took it to have a different meaning. The meaning I got from this film was society in general values youth and beauty in females much more than age and wisdom. The tv execs, film execs are always looking for the younger more bankable female rather than one who's like you said sacrificed and put in the years only then to be put out to pasture.

Another poster made a brilliant analysis on cosmetic surgery and the substance and again looking to continue to drain that fountain of youth long after its run dry. 

I saw Elizabeth as a self centred, narcissistic individual who's only reason for living was herself and her dreams and when she didn't achieve them she saw the cheat code and grabbed it. But unfortunately the old saying cheaters never prosper came back to haunt her.

The fact that the video and voice kept saying you are one interested me because I thought ironically the substance seemed a lot to me like power it should never be given to people who seek and and those willing to say no would probably have more of the mindset to use the substance properly but maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe the substance is always doomed for failure regardless of who takes it because its hardcoded in most of humanity to be selfish and take more than what's needed especially when it's offered on a platter.

I like your analysis too tho. That's why I love films like this. They can mean so many different things to people and none of them are wrong if thought throught critically enough.

There are no silly questions only people. Glad you enjoyed it too :)",1

The only dracula based film I've seen in the past couple of years that was good was Voyage of the Demeter. I really enjoyed that. I'll definitely put Nosferatu on the list. My most anticipated horrors of the year have got to be this Substance and Longlegs.

I keep hoping they make one final scream film and bring Matthew back to play Stu as the killer to tie everything up they could even call it final scream I'm not a scriptwriter but I came up with a pretty good idea for how they could do it even in the last film they show the tv and kirby says yeah his body was never found and he's the only killer who was never definitively shown as dead so they've left the breadcrumbs to do it. All it needs is a good story and someone to pull the trigger.

Can u imagine if, in the final scene, Ghost face removed his mask, and it showed Stus face all scarred up from the tv and said surprise Sidney?
I think people would lose their shit haha",2

I was always that kid. If u told me to do something, I'd do the complete opposite üòÜ ü§£ and I'm 40 now, and I haven't changed and don't plan on starting yet. I do believe as a society we are all far too obsessed with beauty and pretty people when in actuality some of the most attractive people I've met have turned out to be some of the most boring people I ever had the misfortune of meeting.

Whether there's a correlation between highly attractive people say not having to work as hard as the rest of us I dunno but it's a sound theory. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying that every attractive person has the personality of a goldfish but some of the most amazing people I've ever met certainly weren't 8's or 9's in the beauty department lol üòÜ 

It's kinda like the analogy of rich people never having to have worked for anything and always being given everything so easily. Imo the struggle is what builds character and manners too I might add again some of the wealthiest people I've met have turned out to be rude and obnoxious where as people from poorer backgrounds who have had to scratch and claw for everything they've earned have turned out to be some of the nicest, kindest most caring and interesting people I've come across.

My favourite 2 parts are where >!firstly, she takes the peyote and beer can and patches herself back up. Yeah, it's a bit far-fetched surviving the fall, etc, but looking for a deeper meaning I took the cave to represent possibly that she hadn't survived and that was her descent into the inferno especially with the fire etc. But then waking up with the brand, the fact that her flesh now belonged to the devil, maybe I dunno its fun to ponder these things. Secondly, I like the scene where there both messed up at the end blood everywhere. Visibly against the tiles and floor, it's striking, but I don't know if when he slips if that was intentional, but it looked pretty real and glad they kept it in. I love what he does with the cling film or saran wrap for our us cousin's. Digging into that scene and how it plays out I interpreted it as she had to struggle so now it's his turn so that's why she takes her time with him and let's the fear build in him until its her time to strike and exact her Vengeance making her Revenge complete. Also, I've just thought of this and the 7 deadly sins analagy. I dont know if their all there, but wrath, pride, envy and sloth are definitely there im gonna have yo rewatch it now haha!<

I just think it's a well acted, good visuals and sound mixing dark body horror comedy, especially that last act. I don't think it's meant to be taken too seriously, and I find it funny you think Sue kicking Smeagol 2.0 with strength is what stands out as unusual to you in this sort of movie...",11

Damn, that sucks. For me, that scene where Elisabeth (Demi Moore) is preparing for her date and grows frustrated and more hateful towards her own appearance and self was so earnest and devastating. I understand self-hate all too well, so I found her to be incredibly tragic. Actually, it might be good that you don‚Äôt relate xD

I think this movie is also similar to Evil Dead, in that it really works if you vibe with it. But that‚Äôs entirely subjective and up to the viewer‚Äôs individual taste. If you don‚Äôt, then you don‚Äôt. I did, so I had an absolutely great time. Very simple theme but great execution‚Äîloved the visuals, score, campy/outlandish style.

It's extremely blunt, never subtle. It didn't know how to thrill me. There's so much they could have done to make it scary, but they opted for making it funny at best. It really comes across as a film not written by a writer, but an actor, in that they thought ""Oh wow beauty standards bad"" and the film completely relies on that message. But you know the message going in and they don't do anything clever with it. To be fair, I thought it was bad going by the trailer, and it was.

But to me, it felt like they gave someone who just graduated from film school a huge budget, insanely good special effects, a great team for cinematography, amazing actors, and somehow they still failed to make me feel absolutely anything.

Not even the gore felt scary. The characters were one-dimensional and almost clownish. The nudity was excessive, and despite being directed by a woman, the amounts of unnecesarry boobs felt like it was made by a horny man with zero creativity. Somehow it felt slow paced to me, even when they bombarded you with loud sounds and trippy scenes.

It almost made me feel like they thought the audience was too stupid to get the message so they had to cut to little flashbacks showing stuff (like the doctor's scar) or people repeating stuff for you to make the connection. The end was fun though. But again, could have perfectly been achieved as a short film.",2

It's a maximalist satire film that does exactly what it intends to do, hold up a demented mirror to our society much like A Clockwork Orange, NETWORK, or The Holy Mountain (all of which this film reminded me of) or other exaggerated social satires of the 70s..


For me it's similar to the complaint people seem to not be articulating correctly which is that the movie doesn't have anything to ""say"" which really means they didn't like where it went or that it didn't wrap itself up in a nice neat bow or a happy ending (which is what my mom expressed frustruation with) and its like yeah? Why would it though?? Obviously these problems haven't been solved in real life so why do we put the pressure on art/entertainment to provide us the answers?

The Substance is neither a musical nor comedy. Yes there are some funny parts and there is satire. It's not a comedy. Nobody would ever refer to it as a comedy. The intention of the film is not comedy. And it's so far removed from musical it's not even worth pointing out that it's not a musical.

They did the exact same shit with The Bear. ""Oh, here's this thing everyone is talking about and enjoying but we don't respect it enough to give it one of the more prestigious awards so let's just throw the comedy awards at it and if anyone complains we can just say they didn't 'get' it!""

MAYBE, just maybe, we start outright creating the horror category for these awards ceremonies considering this genre has been so enduring, so beloved, and clearly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It's almost as if horror CAN be a vehicle for great cinema ü§î imagine that!",18

For example, instead of Demi going against award heavyweights like Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie, she‚Äôll be up against a newcomer like Mikey Madison. The Globes are one of the first major awards to be announced and the entire award season (leading up the Oscars) is all about building momentum and campaigning hard.",1

i just wish she gone out with fred...and i wished she terminated it much much earlier and tbh i got so angry about sue for treating her this way when she depends on her - like how could she be so dumb and mess it up this badly ??, but i know its just a metaphor for self hatred and body dysmorphia. the movie was really good, but i kinda wish i didnt watch it because it definitley spoke to that disordered part of me and it was like my biggest fear. even the disfigurment, that out of control thing there, its just so scary",4

It says so much about how older women are treated, how people are treated based off how they look (particularly the climax, which has multiple layers), insecurity, mental health.

""There has been a misuse of the substance, a few extra hours were used causing an _alteration_.""

The Substance does a great job of showing a feminine perspective without dismissing how men struggle with the same issues. It even acknowledges it.

The Substance has one of the best portrayals of body dysmorphia I've ever seen,1729273769.0,"1. Why do you use ""female"" for women, but ""men"" for men? Just sounds gross and stupid. ""Female"" and ""male"" are adjectives!! 

2. ""Arguably more"" is so disconnected from reality it's not even funny.

3. Not everything has to be ""guys also have it worse"" or ""not all guys.",15

> arguably more due to the extreme nature of online dating and how 90% of females are going for the top 18% of men only

if you saw the average women's inbox on a dating site you would understand why 82% of these guys aren't getting a response",27

And anyone who thinks that men have it worse than women to look good is so far off base it‚Äôs not even funny.

Society has *always* been about women looking their prettiest and being deemed unworthy if they fail to meet ridiculous standards.

Men have had absolutely nowhere near that pressure. The only men who feel like that‚Äôs a thing are the type of men who think that women should go for them because they‚Äôre so nice or whatever.

Basically, this is incel rhetoric.",33

""You're still as beautiful as you were when you were young!"", no I'm not, and that's fine, Elizabeth's problem was she was THE face and THE body for so long that she didn't think there were outs for her. Hollywood chewed her out so much she that that without the looks she's useless.

The most disheartening part to me was that you can imagine a better future for her if she didn't cave into taking the substance. Ditch the fitness show, date or/and marry ditsy, but ultimately kind-hearted guy, find passion for cooking from the cookbook you got and rebrand yourself as primetime TV chef ala Giada De Laurentiis or Nigella Lawson.

The thing the guy with the birthmark said, something about remembering you're still a person and worthy. We see things from her perspective and she might be an unreliable narrator with the self hate and all the hollywood mambo jumbo. 

The movie wouldn't work if people were more invested in reality. But thanks to everyone being glued to their phones, obsessing over fake influencers and celebs who have it so tough not being 18 forever, it does work. Because people are insane.

The customer service rep that she calls isn't able to care, and the people they're targeting as their userbase would more than likely be those ""susceptible"" to ""overuse"". But a question I have to ask, is wouldn't this be one of the most traumatic and also life-changing (in a positive way) event in one's life?

Could having to hide your aged body and literally stab yourself with a needle not provoke a bit of oddness? Do you think you could do any better if you were told that you're a singular person while existing in two bodies (non-simultaneously) and having to go from ""genetic perfection"" to your old less-than-perfect body? Not a judgment question but one I asked myself, would I if I didn't know the consequences of such a treatment if misused even attempt it? What if I knew? Would the foresight make me feel more confident about the procedure or just decide to live a mundane life?",2

To your question, it‚Äôs a very easy-ish/linear plot to follow even if you self-censor the bonkers bits, but this movie WANTS to make you cringe.

More than a straight horror, thriller or even creature feature Substance is aiming and FULLY hits the BODY horror spooky-ookies bullseye.

TL:DR- like a legit rollercoaster you can close your eyes and enjoy the ride but just like any good rollercoaster if you open your eyes at the scariest bits  you‚Äôll be treated to incredible madness that will make surviving the experience all the more fun and exciting in retrospect.",12
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I absolutely HATE gore and scary movies in general so while the trailers were playing before this movie started, I strongly considered leaving lmao I was nervous. However, I basically closed my eyes throughout the gory parts (you can definitely tell when it‚Äôs going to happen), and still enjoyed the movie LOL. I did get glimpses here and there but nothing that‚Äôll keep me up at night for sure cause it was so whacky looking (as in, unrealistically possible) and just a few seconds long before I looked away.",11

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I am the same. I closed my eyes/covered my face for 25-30% of the movie and I have no regrets. I saw it in the theater. If you think you have a tolerance level where that would work, you could watch it at home later. I think it depends on your level, re: gore. The film gives you pretty fair warning when something grotesque is coming, for the most part (there were a few specifically harrowing scenes where you knew what was coming and I just covered my face for like... a full minute. Because NOPE). THAT said: the sound design is, uh, very good so if it's not just visual for you, yeah skip. 

For me, I'm glad I saw it because I really liked the story/writing/themes and performances. There's SO much rich material in it and things to talk about. I also found it really sad, and kind of beautiful in a weird way? I cried at one bit, which is not something I do w/ horror.",10
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Nope don‚Äôt watch it if you don‚Äôt have the stomach for it. I‚Äôve made the mistake of watching it after my edibles kicked in. Got through about 3/4 of the movie and threw up üòÇ,9

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,There are different kinds of gore. This is more body horror gore and needle gore than bloody gore though there is also bloody gore. Just not as much as I think the word usually suggests to me. I'm sure that wasn't terribly helpful but I can't say more without starting to spoil the movie.,5
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Honestly, based on peoples reactions, I thought that the gore would be worse. I do not like gore at all, but apparently, the 80s style of trash horror that my cousins kept showing to me when we were kids desensitized me enough lol. I refocused on something suddenly interesting on my phone a couple of times, and that was it",7
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"it's more gross than gory, if that makes sense?

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I watched it because I heard so many good things about it but I hate gore in movies.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,I was utterly horrified by the third act of this film. The first two were quite graphic but not necessarily gory. The third part though is very gory. One of Raffertie‚Äôs tracks for the soundtrack is called Blood and the following is More Blood.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Okay so, respectfully, you‚Äôre missing the mark. I would argue, if anything, like countless horrors before, it is using *aging* as the horror element. You know, old people creepy and scary? However, given the theme of the film, it doesn‚Äôt seem mean spirited or even like a trope. My interpretation is that, in our youth we fear and resent aging, but as we age we fear the youth overshadowing us, we fear being forgotten and dismissed since we‚Äôve lost our ‚Äúlight‚Äù and youthful appearance. This film is pretty in your face about those two selves sharing the same ‚Äúbeing‚Äù and fighting for control. It‚Äôs not very subtle about ‚Äúaging actress finds way to turn back the clock‚Äù - >! long story short they are one and can *not* be separated !< - what you‚Äôre seeing is not some reference to burn victims but a freakin lovecraftian nightmare of melded flesh. >!

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,That‚Äôs an incredible reach for someone who clearly hasn‚Äôt seen the full costume.

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I will say that if you look at the full prosthetic design, there are multiple faces/partial faces/facial features and multiple spines- so while this part of the photo does somewhat resemble a severe burn survivor, the larger picture is more like what would happen if multiple beings were fused together or multiple skeletons were growing beneath one skin‚Äî it seems more inspired by an unrealistically extreme version of a teratoma. Burn survivors don‚Äôt grow extra eyes, nostrils, breasts, or teeth.",7
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"I think it‚Äôs just supposed to be a globby mutation of two human beings. The substance explicitly says it‚Äôs made for one time use, and if you disobey that rule as she does, it just turns your body into a fucked up malformed hybrid of your two selves.",3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"You're kinda not wrong. This movie tried to be really progressive but didn't really have anything interesting to say about women and how they're treated for aging, and reverted to having a big part of the body horror be a woman getting older and more decrepit. So feminist /s

It reminded me of X, which thought itself so progressive when in reality its ""horror"" was old women having a sex drive",-1

Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,Those people are being hyperbolic for the purpose of making a point: the shrimp scene is just Dennis Quaid devouring a bunch of shrimp while in close-up with a wide-angle lens. He plays a gross Weinstein-esque studio executive and is telling Demi Moore that her value as a woman has effectively expired. If you are squeamish about body horror and gore it wouldn‚Äôt even rank in the top five list of grossest things you see in the film.,8

Which I do think is part of the brilliance of the film for me, overall. It touches on subjects in an uncomfortable way but it doesn‚Äôt feel like exploitation, even though it‚Äôs quite brutal, absurdist and all around, sad. I felt really seen.",25

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with this movie. It is very poorly written and manages to actually come across as misogynistic through sheer ineptitude. It makes me think that most people are just very unfamiliar with horror movies in general and especially body horror, so they think this is a good one? It's not even interesting in terms of body horror - it's very basic. And both Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's...""versions"" of Elizabeth, for lack of a better word, are extremely shallow and one-dimensional. And it really annoyed me how the movie just sort of forgot about the misogynistic industry that discards women the moment they're not young anymore and frames Demi Moore's obsession with being young as a personal character flaw rather than a structural barrier. Stupid movie",3
Jack Antonoff shares a photo he took calling Margaret Qualley when she was filming The Substance,1729784861.0,"Horror focused on things happening to one's body, specifically grotesque or psychologically disturbing things.

Edit 2: I can‚Äôt reply in this thread but I still want to respond to you, u/Penis_Genius_. It can be for multiple reasons. These studios don‚Äôt campaign for Oscar‚Äôs, and like you said, there‚Äôs a slim chance they win, anyways.  Now let me ask you: WHY is that chance so slim? The academy, meaning the voters behind the awards, do look down on certain genres and elevate certain others. That‚Äôs why the terms ‚Äúoscar bait‚Äù and ‚ÄúOscar snub‚Äù exist. You can tell the kind of movies that are going to sweep awards before they‚Äôre even released. Take one look at Anora and tell me that isn‚Äôt going to take home at least one or two Oscar‚Äôs.

Honestly going into it I didnt really know much at all despite seeing the trailers (that did not reveal much). You are on the right lines but as the film hasnt come out yet/only just came out in many places I dont want to spoil anything. I think it is a very good surprise how Demi Moore (also fantastic here) and Margaret Qualley come to be. 

I will say the story is fairly easy to follow so it should be easy enough to understand what is happening and the stakes at play/the rules they introduce.",14

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I would say that right near the start of the film it certainly is on the nose and heavy handed towards setting the scene for you with the script especially. I would say too that it begins what I call 'artsy' in its cinematography.

But as the story progresses the artsyness gradually declines in line with how the story ramps up and so by the end there is little of that artsyness left replaced by what I would describe as insanity. 

The story is fairly easy to follow and due to the nature of it I appreciated that. Despite that, I would not say that it is consistently heavy handed or on the nose about its dialogue or message after Qualley is introduced especially. I think that the pacing is so spot on and the visual engagement of it (for me at least) completely distracted from feeling any themes they were trying to push were being pushed too hard, although it is very clear what they are going for.",5

New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,Same! I wanted to watch that movie but I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to strong graphic stuff / gore so I didn‚Äôt bother üòî Now it‚Äôs the same case with this movie,2
New Poster for 'The Substance',1726160694.0,"I am glad you brought that up and I think we‚Äôve all needed to have a genuine discussion about things besides moving around it, to preface I haven‚Äôt see it but going off what I‚Äôve read here and in general (no spoilers, I don‚Äôt know anything that happens.)

Whenever I see him or Voight in a movie now, my first instinct is to think what‚Äôs the general reason for it. They both are open with their conservative beliefs and they were in a political movie this year, all the while this movie does come across as progressive and feminist. And AFAIK from brief reading, Quaid is the only one from the cast that‚Äôs really been outspoken about politics here‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ why him? Since he is controversial, and while I can see the point where it does seem he may be playing a bad person, I do still question it.

If it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a good actor, it still feels odd because it can contradict the movies themes in a way. If it‚Äôs because they want to get interest in conservatives watching the movie and maybe present them with progressive ideas I can also see that. Although, I‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt be another movie that doesn‚Äôt really have a stance. I‚Äôve seen a lot of hostility from certain groups being hateful to Erin Moriarty, so it really does make me wonder what exactly is trying to be said, or if there‚Äôs any kind of ulterior message or reinforcement going on.

Requiem for a Dream is one of my top 5 movies of all time, and after typing all this out and with the culture war stuff I do see why they might have casted him, but I don‚Äôt see why auditioned.",2

Movie theater hard drives can be cracked now? The Substance just dropped on the public torrent sites despite no streaming release date.,1728842472.0,"Highly unlikely this is from a ‚Äúmovie theater hard drive‚Äù, or what is known as a Digital Cinema Package (DCP).

DCPs are encrypted pretty intensely. Each reel of the film, which typically has 6 for each video and audio portion, has a unique AES-256 symmetric key. Using brute force to break just one of them would take years and years. (Depending on the calculation you choose, perhaps longer than the age of the universe for each one.) The other attack vectors would require a breakdown of security in the delivery of the asymmetric keys that the projection hardware uses to unlock the symmetric keys. If that breach did actually occur, you can be sure those projectors would be put on the distribution blacklist immediately and not receive future movies. So at most, if this was a leak by way of a DCP, don‚Äôt expect that to be possible going forward.

As for the watermark question. There is watermarking that is (typically) applied to the image and sound, at projection time, by the media block that decrypts and decompresses the media. It is applied in a way that is difficult for an average viewer to spot, but can be detected when a recording of the screen and sound is made and passed into the watermarking detection software. The watermark payload includes the serial number of the player, and the date and time the projection occurred.

If this was a rip from the DCP directly, using the symmetric keys, and NOT from a capture of the projection, it would contain no watermarking, picture or sound, as that is not encoded into the media inside the DCP.

Additionally, the DCP is in a colorspace that would need to be converted to display normally on home televisions. Not impossible to do, but easy to get wrong. It‚Äôs also in a different resolution than the one listed in the nfo. 

To echo the theory of others here, this is likely a pre-release screening rip, intended for awards considerations. As such, it may have a watermark of the original recipient, depending on the source.",4

There are plenty of age appropriate horror-adjacent films that are meant for children if you want to encourage their enjoyment of horror.

I liked 'spooky' movies as a kid and LOVE horror now, but my dad wouldn't even let me watch The Xfiles with him until I was probably 12, and good on him for doing so.¬†",5
"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"I agree with you on movies like Terrifier but kids need to learn how to handle fear the same way they need to handle other emotions like anger and sadness. Horror movies are a great way to do that in a controlled way. 

Also, kids aren't stuck in the theater. You can get up and leave anytime you want. Before I took my oldest to the movies to see one we had previously started watching Children of the Corn and he asked me to stop the movie when the couple thinks they hit a kid. I paused it and we had a chat and I said he didn't have to watch it f her didn't want to. A couple years later he came in my room one day and was like mom I am ready to try again and we watched it. I had to laugh because afterwards he was like that wasn't that scary. I was like I told you so.

So when we went to see Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and he said I want to leave I suggested he sit in my lap and wait 5 minutes and if he still wanted to leave we would. He said okay and before the 5 minutes was up he was already back in his seat and when I asked if he wanted to leave he said no. He had worked through his fear. 

Let me explain how that is helpful.for kids in real world experiences. When we first moved into our old house I had this giant bedroom and while we were fixing up his room he was staying in my room. My room had a big sliding glass door that led to a little balcony. One night I was in the living room watching TV when he comes wandering in rubbing his eyes saying someone was knocking on the door. I figured he had had a bad dream and brought him back to bed. I went back to talk to dad and our roommate and they both heard knocking but assumed it was him just messing around. I went back and grabbed my kid and the butcher knife and we slept on the futon n the living room. Well he slept as I couldn't. This went on for a few months. I did figure out it was some teens messing with us. That was until one night they messed up.and I was there for the knocking and grabbed the butcher knife and ran out the back door like a crazy person. They scattered and ran and did not come back. He was able to handle them messing with him though because I had already taught him how to handle fear. No freaking out or crying or being afraid to go to bed because mom will protect him and handle it. It would be great if kids could just be kids but the world at large doesn't care if they are kids and ad things happen to kids and as a parent you need to teach them how to deal with it.",-14

I usually check movies ahead of time to check the content, but I really wanted to go into this one blind. Did not disappoint. 

They had watched much worse at home, but the combo of dark theatre, loud noise and no phones to distract them made it so much scarier. We chatted the whole way home about it, they thankfully had watched enough behind the scenes clips of other horror movies that they weren‚Äôt too traumatized.",0

"Somebody brought a young child to ""The Substance"" ",1727318066.0,"I totally agree with you 100%, kids absolutely do need to learn how to cope with and confront fear (fear is the mind killer). Part of my respecting kids intelligence is respecting their ability to be profoundly disturbed by the things that they see and hear. My worry is that some parents think that just because their kid isn‚Äôt crying or freaking out, that they‚Äôre not being internally traumatized by the things they‚Äôre seeing, which is why I reference my poltergeist experience because I genuinely thought my brother was fine, and felt absolutely awful when I found out how it had affected him later. But just like my brother there were things I thought I was ready for that I absolutely was not, like the Shining for instance, resulting in a fear of bathtubs that carried on for quite a few years, but hey I knew what I was getting into and I could have walked away and stopped watching at any time. 

That‚Äôs healthy fear that I think every kid goes through, watching a movie that kinda has you shook for a little while, but that‚Äôs something entirely different from people taking their toddlers and such to movies that they can‚Äôt even begin to understand, let alone consent to watching on a giant screen in a loud and dark theater. I respect the way you‚Äôve gone about your parenting, sounds very thoughtful and loving. I‚Äôm looking forward to introducing my kiddo to the horror culture! But I‚Äôm certainly not rushing it haha he‚Äôll be ready when he‚Äôs ready (he plays with my funko pops so he already knows a lot of horror icons names lol)",12

The score is amazing and it elevates every moment of the film. The idea behind it is not new and original, but the way the story is told is fresh and uncompromising. We could probably tell where it would go from the start, but not how far it would go, and that's what makes it stand out. I wouldn't call the message shallow. Shallowness is what the movie depicts, but there are layers to the story. It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the director is mocking the character and has no mercy for her. But I don't think that is the case. We spend plenty of time seeing the way Elisabeth struggles to see her value beyond the looks because of the beauty standards she internalized after years of working in the industry. I felt great sympathy and sadness for the character. It's great that this film hit the nerve and started this conversation, despite the fact that it's divisive in terms of the message and its depiction",11

The satire/commentary  is as deep as a puddle of ditchwater and it lacks any of the pathos or imagination of Cronenberg or the devastating realism of addictiob parables like Requiem For A Dream. It's on the nose and broad  like the Jesus allusions in Zack Snyder film. Whatever little it has to say is very stale for 2024 abd the equivalent of browsing /r/botchedsurgeries for 15 minures and going ""FAKE BEAUTY STANDARDS AMIRITE?""  Finally a movies that dares to say ""We live in a Society"" but make it for chronic-ADD types.


The Nutty Professor but for people who think that's too lownrow so put in Kubrick references and pass it it highbrow.

it's a 4 out of 5 movie that i don't want to ever watch again",6

Still one of the best horrors of the year!",5

I love that it‚Äôs such a simple story and themes so that the sound and visuals could really shine. It really takes you on a ride. I loved and respected it for slamming subtlety against the wall, and for having the balls to keep going and going until the end.

Add to that the recurring flashcards and voice reminders from that unknown person who supplies the substance saying ""both of you are one"" or something along those lines.

If, on the other hand, the message is that everyone in Hollywood is a vain, shallow asshole or an embarrassing sycophant, which would include the people who worked on this film, except for a few individuals who get stepped on (like the poor guy who still thinks Elisabeth is the most beautiful girl in the world), then I can agree with that.

Empezando por el personaje de Denis Quaid, quien se presenta como una caricatura del t√≠pico productor /CEO/ejecutivo Hollywoodense. El cual no es m√°s que un clich√© rancio y narcisista que abusa de su posici√≥n de poder, sin aportar nada nuevo en comparaci√≥n con versiones similares en otras pel√≠culas.

Por otro lado, Qualley, valiendose m√°s de carisma y atractivo visual que de buen guion, logra captar nuestra inmerecida atenci√≥n con su interpretaci√≥n, emulando en cierta medida lo que hizo Arnold Schwarzenegger en ""Terminator 2"". Sin embargo, llegado este punto lo √∫nico que puedo expresar como sentir de un servidor, es, l√°stima ante la imperiosa necesidad de la cinta de provocar en nosotros alguna preocupaci√≥n por las desavenencias que se ciernen sobre la incipiente vida de Sue, el personaje de Margaret, tomando en cuenta que como ya dije no es m√°s que un despojo unidimensional tal y como aquel robot exterminador en la pel√≠cula de James Cameron, pero sin las inherentes justificaciones qu√© hacian qu√© esta condici√≥n superflua en la constricci√≥n del personaje tiviese sentido en esa pel√≠cula.

Sin embargo, no me habr√≠a tomado ni la m√°s m√≠nima molestia de verter mis frustraciones en este comentario si solo esto hubiera sido lo que mis ojos tuvieron el infortunio de ver anoche. Porque a una pel√≠cula le puedo perdonar lo que sea, menos el arrebatarme la suspensi√≥n de la incredulidad. Si bien los efectos especiales pr√°cticos fueron competentes durante primera mitad, una vez iniciado el cl√≠max, se vuelven tan pobres que hube deseado tener cataratas para poder soportar la mediocridad expuesta en pantalla ante mis ojos y as√≠ no sentir que estaba viviendo de nuevo aquel doceavo y √∫ltimo d√≠a de reyes, sabiendo que mis padres eran los que ven√≠an a comerse las galletas qu√© yo pon√≠a debajo del √°rbol de navidad, mientras me escrib√≠an cartas para que me portara bien y as√≠ con suerte hacerme acreedor de juguetes otra vez.",1

It did not gross me out at all, and was expecting a twist and it never happened. Was the twist supposed to be when she stabbed her heart and they both were awake? Ending annoyed me severely.

Body horror can be a very explicit genre but the best films in it are equally if not even more implicit. 

My argument isn't that it isn't a good horror, it's that it being a good horror film doesn't really line up with the insane levels of praise people are throwing at it.

The collision, opposition and interplay of those things gave the movie a tremendous emotional and mental charge. That, and the fact that it didn't once back down or flinch - and had the courage of its convictions.

It was  the bravest, funniest, most horrifying, heartbreaking, salutory and energizing experience I've had at the theatre in ages. Bravo.",7

How many times did I really need to see Qualley‚Äôs ass to get what the movie was going for? 

I will recognize how subjective that is though and I have plenty of films that I prefer longer cuts of for the pure purpose of ‚Äòif love movie why not have MORE movie‚Äô.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rewriting the horror genre or anything like that either.

Why can't it just be solid horror film without any dissenting opinions being called haters or not liking female directors?

 Hac√≠a tiempo que no me apasionaba tanto querer seguir mirando una pel√≠cula llena de simbolismo. 

Seguro que ganar√° premios.",7
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"la pelicula no tuvo sentido desde que una segundo ser sale del cuerpo de la matriz, y eso es lo bueno de la pelicula, ademas de la satira y critica social",5
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Adem√°s de ser horror, tiene un corte surreal. Los eventos ocurre tal como lo har√≠an en un sue√±o, adem√°s ser aleg√≥rica. 

El final es una sobre estimulaci√≥n sensorial. Te abruma los ojos y los o√≠dos con las im√°genes y la banda sonora. Cosa que va aumentando exponencialmente durante la pel√≠cula y culmina todo en este final grotesco y morboso. Est√° padre.",4
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Me imagino porque el final es c√≥mico. Pero creo que nadie nota que el monstruo se ve as√≠ 'misma' en el cuadro de Elizabeth, y nota que en realidad era hermosa y que no necesitaba a Sue, por lo que se pega la cara de Elizabeth y no la de Sue, y la cara de Elizabeth en su espalda era lo √∫nico que no era deforme. Me parece un buen final.",3
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Mal√≠simo final. Toda la pel√≠cula muy interesante, buen√≠sima, bien hecha para tener un final de una pel√≠cula casera hecha por ni√±os de 13 a√±os. Personalmente opino que fue terrible desde que se convirti√≥ en una lava en el piso que se fue caminando. Todo antes de eso, masterpiece.",6

¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Porque rompi√≥ el ritmo. Considero que la escena donde se ve a s√≠ misma completamente deforme en el ba√±o, hubiera sido un buen final, dejando que pas√≥ la fiesta de a√±o nuevo a imaginaci√≥n del espectador.",2
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"A ver, porque estuvo de m√°s, porque fue b√°sicamente un desfile de referencias que la mayor√≠a no entiende, porque no tuvo puto sentido despu√©s de toda la historia que quisieron contar, por m√°s analog√≠as que me digan que ohhh la sangre hace referencia a la sociedad y el consumo y bla bla bla.

Pero bueno, desde el inicio de la historia se tomaron bastantes libertades e incoherencias para terminar de contar la historia as√≠ que ya se ve√≠a que no iba a ser algo serio.

Finalmente, en lo que debo felicitar al director es en el hecho de que en toda la peli por m√°s escenas sensuales y desnudos no sent√≠ excitaci√≥n en ning√∫n momento xD estaba tan asqueado por la sobre saturaci√≥n de los sonidos de tripas y las escenas de sangre y v√≠sceras que solo pod√≠a sentir asco y pena por la mujer y su descenso a la locura.

En fin, los √∫ltimos minutos fueron de m√°s, el climax fue la chica en el ba√±o convirti√©ndose en monstruo y cuando sale hecha ya un monstruo y se imagina que todos la aman, ah√≠ debi√≥ quedar, honestamente.",2
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,Hubo mucha exageraci√≥n con la sangre y el mounstro.,2
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,Yo escuch√© que el final fue una forma gr√°fica en donde se demuestra como Elizabeth le regresa todo el odio que ella recibi√≥ a los dem√°s,2
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"el final es perfecto, lo bizarro que es es parte de la experiencia y de la incomodidad q la directora busca provocar, es la cereza del pastel",2

¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Me toc√≥ ver un video por ah√≠ donde comentaban que ese final era necesario, porque al final el monstruo es la representaci√≥n de que Elizabeth ya no teme a su f√≠sico (ya supero el no amarse a s√≠ misma), por eso tambi√©n vemos como el monstruo trata de arreglarse con aretes y enchinando su mech√≥n de pelo (tratando de humanizarla), adem√°s si hubieran cortado la pel√≠cula en cuanto nace el monstruo algunos nos hubi√©ramos quedado con la duda de ¬øY luego? ¬øSi se presento al show o no?, as√≠ que siento que si era un final necesario jajaja",2
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"A mi me gust√≥. Es simple, es como el cap√≠tulo de Dave el b√°rbaro donde a Candy le sale una espinilla, ella bebe un brebaje para sac√°rsela. Y una vez fuera, la espinilla cobra vida.

La verdad, la parte del final me ayud√≥ a relajarme, porqu√© estuve el 95% de la pel√≠cula con estr√©s y ansiedad",1

¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"En lo personal no me agrado del todo, yo sent√≠ que hasta cierto punto la pelicula mostraba situaciones que se sentian reales, que eso es lo que me hacia sentir tan incomodo, pero todo lo que venian construyendo se fue al ca√±o. El mero mero final (cuando se arrastra a la estrella) fue lo unico que me agrado.",1
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"A mi no me gusto por que empezo chida, pero despu√©s se hizo muy predecible para mi. 


Predecible no esta mal tampoco. Pero en el momento que percibi cual era el ""mensaje"" y como iba a terminar; cheque el reloj y me di cuenta que todav√≠a le quedaba 1hr. 



Por poco me daban ganas de salir, por que se tardaron un chingo en contar una historia tan simple y nomas rellenaron con efectos y tomas cinematogr√°ficas ""chidas"". 



Se sinti√≥ como que ya no habia mas que contar, pero quisieron continuar nom√°s para mostrar que tan h√°biles son como cineastas y presumir su presupuesto.",1

¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,En mi caso cuando fui a verla un par de personas se salieron de la sala e hiba con mi familia y les horroriz√≥ el final como que no toleran lo grotesco y raro y sobre todo el ba√±o de sangre,1
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Yo creo que es molesto por el mismo hecho de que la sustancia va m√°s all√° del terror, es una pelicula muy humana y con un mensaje muy lindo, muchas personas se pueden identificar con la pelicula y con el dolor de las protagonistas.
La trama te hace sentir que llegara a algo, que habr√° un quiebre, que en algun momento, el acto que sigue tendr√° una conclusion. Pero al final , tiran esa construcci√≥n a la basura, y francamente es un poco decepcionante.
 En lo personal, me gust√≥ mucho la pelicula, por lo mismo que ya dije, debo decir que siento rechazo por el genero del terror,  porque normalmente suelen prescindir de hacer buenos personajes o tener una profundidad, m√°s all√° de que de miedo, asco o simplemente sea bizarro. Esta pelicula fue m√°s que eso y siento que es un avance para el genero del terror, pero el final no me convence, preferiria algo mas cliche y lindo, pero igual es bueno que los directores tomen desiciones as√≠, e incursionen formas no tan comunes de hacer las cosas.",1
¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"Pta, se me alarg√≥ demasiado el ba√±o de sangre.  No lo encontr√© malo, pero lo hubiera dejado 10 mins m√°s corto.

¬øPor qu√© no les gust√≥ el final de La Sustancia?,1729618787.0,"El final se siente como otra pel√≠cula, mas surrealista y absurda, lo cual para nada es malo y entiendo el sentido de que terminara de esta manera, a muchas personas los tomo de sorpresa este cambio tan brusco lo cual provoca una sensaci√≥n bastante rara e incomoda que puede interpretarse como que no nos gusta, pero ese justo es el punto. No se si me estoy dando a entender jaja. Si lo miras solo juzgando la historia se siente apresurado y brusco, si juzgas toda la pel√≠cula como concepto integral es un excelente final.",0
